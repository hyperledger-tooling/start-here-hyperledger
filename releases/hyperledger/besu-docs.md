                22.7.0 is our Quarterly release with some big fixes over the previous 22.4.4. This is a recommended update for all users on public networks and those using Bonsai. This release also make many improvements to underlying peering code for better peering on public networks. There are a number of fixes around Merge-related code and the robustness of Besu as a whole.
With the stability of Bonsai in 22.7.0 and some planned optimizations, we are anticipating changing it to the default storage format at some point in the future. We will have more to share on this in the coming months, but nothing more at this time.
This update also includes tweaks and optimizations for memory management, RocksDB, peering default values, and more. See the changelog for more details.
