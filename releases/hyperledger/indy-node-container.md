                Images for node `1.12.4` based on
- Ubuntu 16
- Ubuntu 18
- Debian Buster
- Debian Bullseye
are working and maintain mutual consensus. 

The Ubuntu 20 Image running node `1.13.0~dev206` works and can be started in a network together with the other nodes but will run into consensus problems with them, most likely due to the newer libsodium/libssl version.
