                Release Candidate:

This release includes some new AIP 2.0 features out (Revocation Notification and
Discover Features 2.0), a major new feature for those using Indy ledger (multi-ledger support),
and a fix for a critical bug in some mediator scenarios. The release also includes several new
pieces of documentation (storage database information and logging) and some other documentation
updates that make the ACA-Py [Read The Docs site](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
useful again. And of course, some recent bug fixes and cleanups are included.

For some existing deployments there may be some breaking changes to be aware of in this release, as documented in the [Changelog.md file](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
