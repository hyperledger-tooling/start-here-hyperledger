                A mostly maintenance release with some key updates and cleanups based on community deployments and discovery. With usage in the field increasing, we're cleaning up edge cases and issues related to volume deployments.

The most significant new feature for users of Indy ledgers is a simplified approach for transaction authors getting their transactions signed by an endorser. Transaction author controllers now do almost nothing other than configuring their instance to use an Endorser, and ACA-Py takes care of the rest. Documentation for this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Endorser.md).

Other changes in this release can be found in the Change Log, [Release 0.7.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#072).
