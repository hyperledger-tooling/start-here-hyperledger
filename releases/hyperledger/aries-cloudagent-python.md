                0.7.4 is a significant release focused on stability and production deployments. As the "patch" release number (0.7.3 to 0.7.4) indicates, there were no breaking changes in the Admin API, but a huge volume of updates and improvements.  Highlights of this release include:

- A major performance and stability improvement resulting from the now recommended use of [Aries Askar](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-askar) instead of the Indy-SDK.
- There are significant improvements and tools for dealing with revocation-related issues.
- A lot of work has been on the handling of Hyperledger Indy transaction endorsements.
- ACA-Py now has a pluggable persistent queues mechanism in place, with Redis and Kafka support available (albeit with work still to come on documentation).

In addition, there are a significant number of general enhancements, bug fixes, documentation updates and code management improvements.

This release is a reflection of the many groups stressing ACA-Py in production environments, reporting issues and the resulting solutions. We also have a very large number of contributors to ACA-Py, with this release having PRs from 22 different individuals. A big thank you to all of those using ACA-Py, raising issues and providing solutions.

More details about this release, including the major updates and a categorized list of PRs, can be found in the [Change Log file](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#074).

                **NOTE** We expect 0.7.4-rc5 will the be the last Release Candidate prior to the official 0.7.4 release.

**NOTE:** 0.7.4-rc4 contains a fix for a revocation-related issue introduced in 0.7.4-rc3. We recommend updating to 0.7.4-rc4 immediately if you have been using 0.7.4-rc3.

- See issue: [\#1823](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/1823)
- See Pull Request: [\#1827](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1827)

The 0.7.4 release consists largely of internal fixes to ACA-Py, big increases in performance resulting from the now recommended use of [Aries Askar](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-askar) instead of the Indy-SDK, improvements and tools for dealing with revocation-related issues, plus a number of general enhancements. There have been a lot of groups exercising ACA-Py and the updates made in this release are a reflection of those efforts. We have PRs that have been contributed by 21 different people.
