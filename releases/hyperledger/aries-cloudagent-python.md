                This release includes some new AIP 2.0 features (Revocation Notification and Discover Features 2.0), a major new feature for those using Indy ledger (multi-ledger support), a new "version upgrade" process that automates updating data in secure storage required after a new release, and a fix for a critical bug in some mediator scenarios. The release also includes several new pieces of documentation (upgrade processing, storage database information and logging) and some other documentation updates that make the ACA-Py Read The Docs site useful again. And of course, some recent bug fixes and cleanups are included.
