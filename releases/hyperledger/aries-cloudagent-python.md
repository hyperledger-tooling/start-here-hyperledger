                An urgent update to Release 0.8.1 to address an inability to execute the upgrade command. The upgrade command is needed for Pull Request https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/2116 - "UPGRADE: Fix multi-use invitation performance", which is necessary for (at least) deployments of ACA-Py as a mediator. The important update is Pull Request https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/2185 (listed below).
