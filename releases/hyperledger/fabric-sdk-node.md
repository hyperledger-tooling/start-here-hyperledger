                This v2.2.8 version is the latest of the v2.2 long-term support (LTS) release of the fabric-node-sdk packages that support Fabric 2.x, and supersedes previous v2.x releases. Please see the Fabric LTS release strategy document for more information on LTS releases:

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/blob/main/text/0005-lts-release-strategy.md

This release updates dependencies and addresses an issue that could prevent client applications from stopping cleanly.

Changes in this release:

- When using a Hardware Security Module, the label associated with the slot containing the client identity's credentials can be specified instead of the slot index. This provides a more robust mechanism for specifying the correct HSM slot.
