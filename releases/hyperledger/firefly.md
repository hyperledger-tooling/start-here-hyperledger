You can view the release notes for each release candidate for more details: [rc.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1) [rc.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2) [rc.3](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3) [rc.4](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.4) [rc.5](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.5) [rc.6](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6)

## Breaking Changes and Migrations

* **firefly-dataexchange-https** must be upgraded to 1.0.0 alongside FireFly core, as the ack event [has been renamed](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/pull/656) from "commit" to "ack". Upgrading dependencies alongside FireFly is always recommended, but running mismatched versions of FireFly and dataexchange in this case will cause event processing to stall completely.
* Some of the APIs for creating contract listeners have changed - see #685
* Some field names under TokenPool, TokenTransfer, and TokenApproval have been adjusted - see #709
