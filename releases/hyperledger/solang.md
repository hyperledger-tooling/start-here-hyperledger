                We are happy to release solang `v0.2.0` codenamed `Berlin` today. Aside from containing many small fixes and improvements, this release marks a milestone towards maturing our Substrate compilation target: Any regressions building up since `ink!` v3.0 are fixed, most notably the metadata format (shoutout and many thanks to external contributor [extraymond](https://github.com/extraymond)) and event topics. Furthermore, we are leaving `ink!` version 3 behind us, in favor of introducing compatibility with the recent `ink!` 4 beta release and the latest pallet contract `v0.22.1`.

### Added
- **Solana / breaking:** The try-catch construct is no longer permitted on Solana, as it
   never worked. Any CPI error will abort the transaction.

- **Solana:** Introduce new sub-command `solang idl` which can be used for generating
  a Solidity interface file from an Anchor IDL file. This can be used for calling
  Anchor Contracts on Solana. [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- **Substrate:** Provide specific Substrate builtins via a "substrate" file. The
  `Hash` type from `ink!` is the first `ink!` specific type made available for Solidity
  contracts.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Introduce the `--log-api-return-codes` CLI flag, which changes the
  emitted code to print return codes for `seal` API calls into the debug buffer.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- Introduce function name mangling for overloaded functions and constructors, so
  that they can be represented properly in the metadata.

### Changed
 - The Solana target now uses Borsh encoding rather than eth abi
   encoding. This is aimed at making Solang contracts Anchor compatible.
   [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Supported node version is now pallet contracts `v0.22.1`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Remove the deprecated `random` builtin.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

### Fixed
 - Whenever possible, the parser does not give up after the first error.
   [salaheldinsoliman](https://github.com/salaheldinsoliman)
 - Constant expressions are checked for overflow.
   [salaheldinsoliman](https://github.com/salaheldinsoliman)
 - AddMod and MulMod were broken. This is now fixed.
   [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Solang is now compatible with `ink!` version 4 (beta).
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Switched ABI generation to use official `ink!` crates, which fixes all
  remaining metadata regressions.
  [extraymond](https://github.com/extraymond) and [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Allow constructors to have a name, so that multiple constructors are 
  supported, like in `ink!`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- All provided examples as well as most of the Solidity code snippets in our
  documentation are now checked for succesful compilation on the Solang CI.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Fix events with topics. The topic hashes generated by Solang
  contracts are now exactly the same as those generated by `ink!`.
