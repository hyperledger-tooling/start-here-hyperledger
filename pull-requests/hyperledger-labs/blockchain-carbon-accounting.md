                This PR adds a service class for interacting with the OrbitDB database containing all the emissions factors and lookup identifiers. Instructions for how to use the service:
* Move into the `utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup/data` directory
* Load in the emissions factors and identifiers using the `src/dataLoader.ts` script
* Fetch or query for emissions factors using the methods provided by the service. An example for usage has been given in the `src/getData.ts` file. Please note that this file must be run with the current working directory being `data` and not `data/src`.
