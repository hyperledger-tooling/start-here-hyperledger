                This PR allows the data loader to load in scope-wise emissions factors from the "UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting" flat file [available here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2021).

You can load in the factors by running:
`ts-node src/dataLoader.ts load_utility_emissions conversion-factors-2021-flat-file-automatic-processing.xls`
in the `docker-compose-setup/data` directory.

<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md">handlebars's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v4.7.7 - February 15th, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>fix weird error in integration tests - eb860c0</li>
<li>fix: check prototype property access in strict-mode (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736">#1736</a>) - b6d3de7</li>
<li>fix: escape property names in compat mode (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736">#1736</a>) - f058970</li>
<li>refactor: In spec tests, use expectTemplate over equals and shouldThrow (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1683">#1683</a>) - 77825f8</li>
<li>chore: start testing on Node.js 12 and 13 - 3789a30</li>
</ul>
<p>(POSSIBLY) BREAKING CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changes from version <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020">4.6.0</a> now also apply
in when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods
can be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties
from your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>
