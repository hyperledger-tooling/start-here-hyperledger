                This PR allows the data loader to load in scope-wise emissions factors from the "UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting" flat file [available here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2021).

You can load in the factors by running:
`ts-node src/dataLoader.ts load_utility_emissions conversion-factors-2021-flat-file-automatic-processing.xls`
in the `docker-compose-setup/data` directory.
