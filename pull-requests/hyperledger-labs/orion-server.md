                Handle a config TX that carries a membership change, i.e. adding or removing a member peer.

If a config transaction carries changes to the cluster membership, i.e. add or remove a node, it is proposed
using Raftâ€™s ProposeConfChange(), with the config-block as Context field of the proposal.
This allows consensus on the new Raft membership, while consenting on the new config-block at the same time.
If the config tx does not carry changes to the cluster membership it is proposed using the normal Propose().

Implement peer removal and addition, but test only removal.
- When a node is removed, it is recommended to shutdown the removed node prior to proposing the removal config-tx.
- If the removed node is alive, it detects its own removal after it commits and then shuts down the replication component.
- The removed server may continue to serve queries until it is shutdown.
- The removed server always reports the Leader-RaftID=0, so it cannot be used for transactions.

Adding a peer is still not supported (future commit).

                Define the rules for updating the ConsensusConfig, in particular, the Memebrs.

The core contribution is the VerifyConsensusReConfig method, that checks the configuration changes in types.ConsensusConfig.

This method checks that the changes between one ConsensusConfig to the next are safe, because some mutations might
cause a permanent loss of quorum in the cluster, something that is very difficult to recover from.
 - Members can be added or removed (membership change) one member at a time
 - Members' endpoints cannot be changed together with a membership change
 - An existing member cannot change its Raft ID (it must be removed from the cluster and added again as a new member)
 - The Raft ID of a new member must be unique - therefore it must be larger than MaxRaftId

We assume that both the current and updated ClusterConfig are internally consistent, specifically, that the Nodes
and the ConsensusConfig.Members arrays match by NodeId in each.
