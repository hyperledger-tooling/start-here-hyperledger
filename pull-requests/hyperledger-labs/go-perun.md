                In #306, we disabled update abortion under the assumption that there aren't many use cases for it.

Since then, we discovered that in two of our applications we were using this functionality (perun-credential-payment and perun-websocket-backend).

Hence, I propose to enable it again.

                This PR proposes to initialize the wire encoding explicitly when needed, instead of setting it via an implicit import. This allows a user to have a better understanding which component uses which encoding and when setting an encoding is not necessary (for example, in case of using a local bus).

                - eth/channel: Use types.LatestSigner for all sim backend tests
  - Before, `types.EIP155Signer`s were created in many different places.
It is recommended by the geth folks to use `types.LatestSigner` instead.
This was streamlined an there's now a common `channel/test.SimSigner` that
can always be used together with the simulated backend.
  - `FundAddress` and `Test_ConfirmTransaction` were adapted to use the
new `types.DynamicFeeTx`.
  - The unused `test.GasLimit` variable was deleted.
  - The `test.GasPrice` variable was renamed to `InitialGasBaseFee` and its
description updated.
- eth/channel: Don't set `GasPrice` in `ContractBackend.NewTransactor`
  - Setting `TransactOpts.GasPrice` forces the transactions to be sent as a
legacy transaction, instead of a type 2 EIP1559, which results in much
higher gas costs.
  - Also remove the `SuggestedGasPrice` method from the `SimulatedBackend`, as
it is not used anymore, because EIP1559 TXs are now sent everywhere.

Opened as a draft to let @ndzik try it out first if we truly now send EIP1559 txs.
