                This is the second implementation variant where the `ProposeChannel` method does not automatically settle the channel after a failed funding but the client itself has to take care of this.

                For verifying signatures, we require that the State.Data encoding is stable, that is, `E(data) = E(D(E(data)))`. This PR proposes to specify that requirement at the Interface.

                Previously, we introduced error channels for immediate error handling.
However, this was done at the expense of requiring an additional error
channel parameter during testing setup, which made it more complicated
to setup a client test. Now the error channels are kept only with the
role and the changes to the setup function parameters are reverted.
