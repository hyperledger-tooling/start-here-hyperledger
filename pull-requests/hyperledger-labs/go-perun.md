                ## Description:
This Pull Request aims to upgrade the Go programming language version to 1.21 across the project. Additionally, it includes updates to the GitHub Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to accommodate the new version and ensures the codebase passes the updated linter.

## Changes Proposed:
### Upgrade Golang Version:

The Golang version has been updated from 1.17 to 1.21.
### Update GitHub CI Pipeline:

Modifications have been made to the existing GitHub CI pipeline configuration to support the updated Golang version.
The pipeline now includes steps for testing and building the project with Go 1.21.
### Code Changes:

- Necessary changes have been implemented throughout the codebase to ensure compatibility with Go 1.21.

- Any deprecated or outdated constructs have been replaced with their equivalent supported versions.

- The codebase has been refactored to pass the updated linter without errors or warnings.
### Why This Change is Necessary:
- Stay Current: Upgrading to the latest Golang version ensures that the project benefits from the latest language features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
- Maintain Compatibility: Keeping the project up-to-date with the latest Golang version ensures compatibility with other libraries, tools, and dependencies.
- Enhance Code Quality: Updating the linter and addressing any issues found ensures that the codebase adheres to best practices and maintains a high level of quality.
