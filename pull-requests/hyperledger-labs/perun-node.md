#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail. -->

- Currently, session.NewChForTet function sets the response timeout
  internally. Hence this value is not known to calling funcs in test.

- Refactor the func to take response timeout as an additional parameter.
  Because, the value is reaquired in tests for upcoming changes (#132).
