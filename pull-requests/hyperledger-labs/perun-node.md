#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail. -->

- Contract registry is implemented to keep track of adjudicator and
  asset ETH and asset ERC20 contracts.

- This is initialized by the node and it is passed onto each of the
  sessions with a read-only access.

- In upcoming changes, APIs will be added in node to add new ERC20 asset
  contracts to the contract registry.

Also,

- Update SetupContracts test helper function to setup ERC20 assets and
  return a contract registry instead of contract addresses.

- Update the reference templates for node & session config.
