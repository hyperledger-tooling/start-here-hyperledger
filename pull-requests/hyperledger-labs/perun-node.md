#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail. -->

- Currently weak scrypt parameters are used in tests within session
  package and for generating test data, while standard scrypt parameters
  are used everywhere else (integration tests in other packages, CLI &
  TUI apps).

- This causes the open session action in these tests and apps to be
  slower. Since, we use perun-node only in test environments with no
  real funds, use weak scrypt parameters everywhere to make the test and
  apps faster.
