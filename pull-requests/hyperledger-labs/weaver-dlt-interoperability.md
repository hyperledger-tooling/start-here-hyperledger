                Implemented a set of library functions that can be exercised by any Fabric application chaincode that is managing assets. Via the function API exported by this case class, the application chaincode can trigger asset locks and claims (processed eventually by the Fabric Interop Chaincode) for a cross-network atomic swap. Presently, only the HTLC mechanism is supported for such swaps. 

Also defined common structures (protobufs) relevant to the asset exchange protocol.
