<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">node-forge's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>1.3.1 - 2022-03-29</h2>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>RFC 3447 and RFC 8017 allow for optional <code>DigestAlgorithm</code> <code>NULL</code> parameters
for <code>sha*</code> algorithms and require <code>NULL</code> paramters for <code>md2</code> and <code>md5</code>
algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.3.0 - 2022-03-17</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification issues were reported by Moosa
Yahyazadeh (<a href="mailto:moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu">moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu</a>).</li>
<li><strong>HIGH</strong>: Leniency in checking <code>digestAlgorithm</code> structure can lead to
signature forgery.
<ul>
<li>The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can
allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked
portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low
public exponent is being used. For more information, please see
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/">&quot;Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery based on implementation
error&quot;</a>
by Hal Finney.</li>
<li>CVE ID: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24771">CVE-2022-24771</a></li>
<li>GHSA ID: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765">GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HIGH</strong>: Failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature
forgery.
<ul>
<li>The code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a
<code>DigestInfo</code> ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed
and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is
being used.  For more information, please see <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/">&quot;Bleichenbacher's RSA
signature forgery based on implementation
error&quot;</a>
by Hal Finney.</li>
<li>CVE ID: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24772">CVE-2022-24772</a></li>
<li>GHSA ID: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-x4jg-mjrx-434g">GHSA-x4jg-mjrx-434g</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>MEDIUM</strong>: Leniency in checking type octet.
<ul>
<li><code>DigestInfo</code> is not properly checked for proper ASN.1 structure. This can
lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid
structures but a valid digest.</li>
<li>CVE ID: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24773">CVE-2022-24773</a></li>
<li>GHSA ID: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr">GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>[asn1] Add fallback to pretty print invalid UTF8 data.</li>
<li>[asn1] <code>fromDer</code> is now more strict and will default to ensuring all input
bytes are parsed or throw an error. A new option <code>parseAllBytes</code> can disable
this behavior.
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: The previous behavior is being changed since it can lead to
security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible that code doing custom
DER parsing may need to adapt to this new behavior and optional flag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[rsa] Add and use a validator to check for proper structure of parsed ASN.1</li>
</ul>
