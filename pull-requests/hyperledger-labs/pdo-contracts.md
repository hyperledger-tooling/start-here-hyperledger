                This PR provides a PoC for tokenization and policy-based access of (possibly private) models hosted on Hugging Face, and made available for inferencing via Serverless Inference API. The PoC in spirit is similar to what is demonstrated via the inference contract family, where we provided PDO contracts/guardians for policy-based access control of ML models hosted via OpenVINO model server.

Please see hfmodels-contract/README.md for problem statement, solution overview, and details on how to test the PoC.
