                ### THIS CONTRACT FAMILY IS WORK IN PROGRESS

Initial commit for a new contract family for identity and policy. An identity is a contract that manages a collection of hierarchically generated keys. As a result, a standard format for keys would involve <contract_id>/<key1>/key2>/.... 

The policy support is incomplete. Documentation for (and serialization/deserialization of) verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations is available.

                Adds Jupyter notebook support for creating a token issuer for the digital asset contract family. The digital asset contract family is a demonstration contract that creates tokens and guardian objects for 24bit bitmap images. 

The notebooks for DA use widgets for uploading the image file and creating the tokens. This is a new approach.
