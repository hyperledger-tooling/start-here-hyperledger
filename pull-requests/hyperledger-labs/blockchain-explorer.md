#### What this PR does / why we need it:

Load only the blocks and transactions as per the configuration. Currently the configuration defines to archive or delete old data from the database. But at the bootstrap time, the Explorer tries to read every data from block 0. This can be configured to load only the data from certain point in time that is as expected by the Explorer's configuration.

_This will help in speeding up the bootstrap time of Explorer, the tool and the UI will be ready in shorter period._

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
Change the image location in docker-compose pointing to GHCR . Earlier the images were stored in docker-hub. From now on the images would be stored in GHCR. To suffice this requirement, need to update the docker-compose.
