#### What this PR does / why we need it:
This feature enables the explorer to indicate the health status of peers and orderers that are online or offline.
The status can be indicated with red being offline, green being online, green with flickering - fetching status.
As of now the explorer is not showing the status of peers/orderers that are part of HLF-Network. With this new feature enablement, we could display the health status of peers/orderers in the explorer dashboard.

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
This functionality enables the explorer to retrieve data using block id, block range (for example, blocks 1 to 10), and transaction data by giving the transaction id .Using these inputs, matching data are pulled in accordance with the user's search selection. First it will check whether the data is available in the PostgreSQL, if it is there it will fetch from there, otherwise it will fetch from blockchain.

With this new feature, data is fetched from the blockchain if it is not available in PostgreSQL using the block number, block number range, or transaction id.
