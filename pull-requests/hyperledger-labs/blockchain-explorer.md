#### What this PR does / why we need it:
The addition of a new feature in the Chaincodes tab that opens a dialogue model to show the details related to particular Chaincode. The new feature provides quick and easy access to important information related to the Chaincode.
With the new feature being added to the application, user can now have more visibility into the smart contracts they are using. One such feature is the ability to view the structure of the contract and its associated metadata information
