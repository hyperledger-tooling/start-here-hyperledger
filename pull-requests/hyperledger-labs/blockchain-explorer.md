#### What this PR does / why we need it:
This feature enables the explorer to indicate the health status of peers and orderers that are online or offline.
As of now the explorer is not showing the status of peers/orderers that are part of HLF-Network. With this new feature enablement, we could display the health status of peers/orderers in the explorer dashboard.
