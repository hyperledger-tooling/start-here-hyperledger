#### What this PR does / why we need it:
Backend - Issue in updating the Txn count w.r.t mutiple versions of the same chaincode and issue in fetching the chaincodes list w.r.t to other channel.
Considerations:
Tested with Hyperledger Fabric Version 2.2 and 2.4.7
No of Channels -2
channel Name:"mychannelb" In this channel the deployed chaincode name is "basic" and with versions 1 and 2. The other deployed chaincode is "auction" with version 1.
channel name: "channel2" In this channel the deployed chaincode name is "auction" - version 1.

Issue#1: When we invoke a Txn, the Txn count is incrementing by one in all the available versions of the same chaincode.
Isse#2: Issue in fetching the list of chaincodes when there are multiple channels.
The chaincode installed in channel2 is only "auction" but it is picking even the "basic- V2" chaincode which is installed in channel - mychannelb.
Expected Correct Behaviour:
The correct Txn count w.r.t chaincode version.
Fetch the correct list of chaincodes installed with specific to channels.
