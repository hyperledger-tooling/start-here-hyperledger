                Prior diagrams used the term "Global Synchronizer" which is a brand name controlled by the Global Synchronizer Foundation, and is just one example of how Splice may be implemented to provide governance and tokenomics for a decentralized Canton synchronizer.

This diagram also replaces the term "SV App", which was used to the describe the Validator node operated by a Super Validator. The updated diagram calls this node the SV Validator node, for better consistency. It also replaces the terms "SV 1" and "SV 2" with "Super Validator 1" and "Super Validator 2"
