                ### Description
This PR addresses Issue #20 . Users can now interact directly with the frontend, receiving their typed messages in the chatbox.

Due to hardware limitations, testing the connection between the frontend and backend hasn't been performed. The relevant code is written but currently commented out.

### Current Progress

                Key changes:
- Added the file fetchAndOrganizeData.py. This file collects data from all the links provided in config.yaml. The collected data is then organized in a dedicated folder containing all the HTML files gathered.
- In ingest.py, we've added some debugging code to print the total number of chunks. Additionally, the creation of the chromadb folder is now automated.
- I've also included a Dockerfile and added usage commands for both Docker and non-Docker environments.
