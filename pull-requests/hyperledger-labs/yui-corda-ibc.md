                This is incomplete/experimental implementation yet.
Especially at the moment, Cash states are locked to a _TRUSTED_ user (called "Bank"), while they are supposed to be locked to a smart contract in the ICS-20 spec.
In the future work, this gap will be filled using the encumbrance feature of Corda.
