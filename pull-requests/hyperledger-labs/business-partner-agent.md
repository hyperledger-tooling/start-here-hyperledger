Small fix on view credential exchange when you are a holder and haven't stored the schema.

                As a prerequisite for the manual credential proposal flow I had to merge the issuer and holder tables into one. Like this we have the same behavior as with the presentation flows. So in the ui the user will also see the credentials that have been received from a partner, and not only those that were issued.
