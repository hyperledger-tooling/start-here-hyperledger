                Draft only right now.

Changes to UX to load both Material Design and Font Awesome icons, use constants in pages to load the icons. This will allow different teams to just override the value for the constant and have a different icon set.  Also added in a SASS stage to help with changes in styling for each team.

Adding a top level area for managing credentials (issue/revoke). We will need to consider configuration parameters and security roles/groups to enable/disable sections and actions. That is a future task once functionality is implemented.

                BPA satisfies the `auto-respond-presentation-request` acapy flag behaviour and constructs the first valid response available and replies immediately. 

Work-in-progress frontend to see pending proof requests, but none will exist in that due to the current auto-responding implementation. 

This a partial PR that includes alot of the meat of the backend work.

TODO:
- [] handle get pending query params
- [] cleanup (and maybe rename) ProofManager.presentProof. 
- [] handle predicates in the proof-request
- [] Add tests
