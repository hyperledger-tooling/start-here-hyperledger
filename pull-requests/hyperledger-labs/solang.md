                I reorganized the installation instructions from our docs, making it clear that the one needs to install Solana's LLVM fork before building Solang, following the suggestion from #948.

                This PR introduces a few changes to the builtin structs in Solang.

1. `Type::Struct(usize)` has changed to `Type::Struct(StructType)` to encompass both user defined structs and builtin structs.
2. Solana builtin structs are now held in a new data structure. We can easily retrieve their `StructDecl` data using `StructType::get_definition`. This works also for user defined structs.
3. `codegen::Expression::ExternalFunction` has been eliminated, because I replaced it by a `StructLiteral` of `Type::Struct(StructType::ExternalFunction)`.
4. External function was defined as a struct of `{address, selector}`. I changed it to `{selector, address}` to coincide with its encoding form.

There was an idea to get rid of `Type::ExternalFunction` in favor of `Type::Struct(StructDecl::ExternalFunction)` in codegen, however, this would mean boilerplate code for converting types allowed in the AST to types allowed in codegen. In addition, a large refactoring in `cfg.vars` was needed to avoid mismatching types. Thus, this has not been done.

                Fixes https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/issues/584

# Description
- Add debug information to functions and instructions of the LLVM IR generated by `solang`.
- The return instruction `ret` currently does not have the debug location. But it is the case that the return `ret` instruction does not have the corresponding Solidity program statement. It is a special case when it is generated by `solang`.

                This adds the seeds parameter to external calls. This does not enable creating PDA style contracts yet, that will come in another PR.

This PR simply adds the seeds to `contract.function{seeds: [ [ seed1 ], [ [ seed2 ]}(arg1, arg2);`.

                This PR implements assignment to an external function's selector and address in Yul, using the existing infrastructure in Solang.
The logic behind this is going to be used for Borsh decoding and brought up issue #944.
