// @return feh

function f3() pure returns (int, int) { return (1, 2); }

Allow unnamed returned value to have doc comments, while ensuring that
there is on per return.

Also fix the location of doc-comments in diagnostics.

Documentation for the syntax is in the documentation of this commit, and not repeated here.

                I tried to fix this but I believe Hit some lalrpop issues, so this won't build I'm afraid. 
But not sure what the proper fix for this would be, so I'd need some help


Background

this is a valid revert:

```solidity
        function doRevert2() internal pure {
             revert LibName.ErrorName();
        }
```

if an error is defined inside a library `LibName` 

the solidity grammar states the revert stmt is `"revert" + expr + call-arg-list`
But I think only this is valid (Id)? ("." Id)*

                prior to this `byte` was tokenized as `Token::Bytes(1)` as prior to 0.8.0 `byte` used to be an alias for `bytes1`

however this breaks the assembly `byte` function

```solidity
            assembly {
                v := byte(0, mload(add(signature, 0x60)))
            }
```

This PR

* adds a `"bytes" => Byte` token, that will be `Bytes(1)` if used as type or a yulidentifier

                This PR refactor code generation. The main addition was the `codegen::Expression`. This means we no longer depend on `ast::Expression` to build the CFG. I've managed to improve some other stuff:

1. Now, we have a `cast` function for codegen. 
2. Sema's `cast` function is now a method of `ast::Expression`.
3. I created traits for common functions to facilitate implementing methods with generic arguments.
4. I removed from the AST expressions that do not belong there, except `FunctionArg`, to which I couldn't find an easy solution.
5. Some AST expressions do not exist is the CFG, so I removed references to them in codegen.
6. As we are branching at every AND and OR expression, they do not exist in `codegen::Expression`. However, I left some block comments containing the code to handle those cases, in case we add them in nearby future.

PS: This PR modifies 56 files, so please, @seanyoung, be pedantic!
