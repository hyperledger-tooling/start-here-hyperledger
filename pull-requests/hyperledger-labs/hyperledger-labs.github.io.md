                Learning Tokens is a mechanism that uses the composable Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework (IWA TTF) to produce a Learning Token as a positive reinforcer that recognizes, registers, and rewards community engagement in collective learning and also certifies skills acquisition and competencies. 

With IWA TTF, we define common token concepts with our requirements and particular behaviors, linking their base Token Classification Hierarchy with our Taxonomy of DLT/Blockchain Educational Opportunities as initial metadata for standard artifacts and control message descriptions.

There are robust foundations for this project. Hyperledger and Global Blockchain Business Association, GBBA, are Launch Associate Members of the Interwork Alliance, IWA. Digital currencies and NFT open-source repositories are available. We shall take advantage of eThaler, the ongoing work of NEFERTI, and the IWA Github repositories for artifacts.
