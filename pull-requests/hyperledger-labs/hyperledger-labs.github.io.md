                This is a PR for creating a lab project for Aries wrapper to Fabric Network

Self - Sovereign Identity application is an application by which you are able to keep your identity secured and at the same time also prove your identity to the verifier without revealing them. These applications are built using Hyperledger Aries, which depends on Indy as a Distributed Ledger and Ursa as a cryptography library. Currently, the most used Blockchain platform is Hyperledger Fabric. And the businesses that are building solutions using Fabric want to have some sort of identity verification to be done in their platform. This is the reason, why this project has come into existence. Once done it would enable Aries to interact with Fabric as a ledger, which would then enable SSI applications to be built on top of Fabric.

                nifty will be a low-code, metaprogrammable, standards sensitive and highly secure implementation to issue and trade NFTs, in a protocol agnostic way. 
nifty code will address market place utilities for issuance and trading of NFTs.
