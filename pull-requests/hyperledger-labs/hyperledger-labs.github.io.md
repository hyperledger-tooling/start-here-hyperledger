                YUI is a project to achieve interoperability between multiple heterogeneous ledgers. The project provides modules and middleware for cross-chain communication as well as modules and tools for cross-chain application development, including an explorer to track status and events for cross-chain environment.

For cross-chain communication, the design of project is based on Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol by Cosmos project, with extensions to support various Hyperledger project.

Modules for cross-chain application development includes one that implements a protocol for atomic operations between ledgers, such as atomic swap of tokens.
