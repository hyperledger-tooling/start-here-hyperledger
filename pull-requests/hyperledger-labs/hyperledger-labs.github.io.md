This PR fixes it.

                [Hyperledger Fabric]('https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric') is a permissioned, modular, and extensible open-source DLT platform. Fabric architecture follows a novel `execute-order-validate` paradigm that supports distributed execution of untrusted code in an untrusted environment. Indeed, Fabric-based distributed applications can be written in any general-purpose programming language.  
Fabric does not depend on a native cryptocurrency as it happens for existing blockchain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency.

Blockchain technologies are accelerating the shifting towards a decentralised economy. Cryptocurrencies are reshaping the financial landscape to the extent that even central banks are now testing the technology to propose what is known as the `central bank digital currency`. But it is more than this. Real-world assets are being tokenised as fungible or non-fungible assets represented by tokens on a blockchain. Thus enabling business opportunities to extract more value.

Developing token-based applications for Hyperledger Fabric is not easy. Fabric does not provide an out-of-the-box SDK that let developers create tokens that represents any kind of asset. Developers are left on their own and this exposes them to useless duplication of code and security vulnerabilities.

What would happen if the developers could use a `Fabric Token SDK` that let:
- Create tokens that represents any kind of asset (baked by a real-world asset or virtual);
- Choose the privacy level that best fits the use-case without changing the application logic;
- Orchestrate token transaction in a peer-to-peer fashion;
- Perform atomic swaps;
- Audit transactions before they get committed;
- Interoperate with token systems in other blockchain networks;
- Add a token layer to existing Fabric distributed application?
Developing Enterprise Token-based distributed applications would become simpler and more secure.

                [Hyperledger Fabric]('https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric') is a permissioned, modular, and extensible open-source DLT platform. Fabric architecture follows a novel `execute-order-validate` paradigm that supports distributed execution of untrusted code in an untrusted environment. Indeed, Fabric-based distributed applications can be written in any general-purpose programming language.  

Developing applications for Hyperledger Fabric is often hard, sometimes painful. Fabric is a very powerful ecosystem whose building blocks must be carefully orchestrated to achieve the desired results. Currently, the Fabric Client SDKs are too limited. They do not offer any advanced capabilities to let the developers focus on the `application business processes`, and harness the full potential of Fabric.

What would happen if the developers could use a `Smart(er) Fabric Client` that offers:
- A high level API that hides the complexity of Fabric;
- A Peer-to-Peer infrastructure that let business parties talk to each as required by the business processes;
- An advanced transaction orchestration mechanism;
- A simplified model to interact with chaincodes;
- A local storage place where to store the states the application cares about;
- A State-based programming model that let you forget about RW sets and focus on business objects and their interactions?
Developing Fabric-based distributed applications would become simpler and joyful.
If you are a domain expert, the Fabric Smart Client hides the complexity of Fabric and allows you to focus on the business interactions.
If you are a skilled software engineer, you will be able to leverage the full power of Fabric.
