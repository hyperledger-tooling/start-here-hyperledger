                Copyright infringement is a big issue in today's world, where intellectual property is often worth more than a physical one. When piracy websites distribute copyrighted media by some other entity, it makes that entity lose money, and as a result, even governments lose their share of taxes. Such infringements lead to more minor purchases of the copyrighted content through legal means, and it also lowers the income of industries that produce such content.

Encryption and device restrictions are often not enough to limit piracy; another way to limit it would be to target websites that distribute copyright content illegally.

Our system is a distributed system with a blockchain ledger maintaining information on the copyrighted content provided by the legal owner of such content that could be accessed by our crawler as a sample to identify content similar to it on unauthorized websites. The crawler will index the URL and IP address of the platform hosting the content illegally. It notifies the concerned owner of the content, who verifies whether the content belongs to them. Post verification, the illegal distributor or the content can be taken down from the internet.
