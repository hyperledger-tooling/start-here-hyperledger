                This PR removes the machinery for configuring the IAS root certificate at build time, and moves the task to the crypto cmake.

Two notes.

First, the artifacts -- namely the IAS root certificate and the crypto header which embeds the certificate itself -- are now generated by cmake itself, and they are not cleaned up through make. For this reason, both have been moved within the build folder -- so that they are removed when the build folder itself is removed.
This is fine for the crypto header, since it's only necessary when compiling the crypto libraries -- other sources do not need to include it.

Second, the root certificate is always built into the crypto library by default, thereby simplifying the code.

                This PR replaces the deprecated python .egg package format for the eservice and pservice with the python .whl format. This is achieved by using more recent python build and install tooling.

                Rewrite the docker containerization
    
This is a complete rewrite of the dockerization of PDO. This
approach is designed to grealy simplify deployment of containers
for long running services. There are very few management tools
included in the PR (that would be a separate project), but the
documentation includes a fair amount of information on different
patterns of use.
    
Several important differences:
  
* The build process mostly implements the separation of build,
install, configure and run. base dockerfile sets up the basic
build environment; pdo_base and ccf_base build the services and
can be used for development; client, ccf and services are for
running configured containers.

* There is now a single way for passing in the repository that
is used for building. By default it will be created in the directory
where the docker images are built.

* The client is separated from the services for both testing and
deployment. This should improve testing and provide an image for
clients to install to "kick the tires"
