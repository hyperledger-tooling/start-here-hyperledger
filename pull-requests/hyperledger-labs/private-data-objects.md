                This PR removes the machinery for configuring the IAS root certificate at build time, and moves the task to the crypto cmake.

Two notes.

First, the artifacts -- namely the IAS root certificate and the crypto header which embeds the certificate itself -- are now generated by cmake itself, and they are not cleaned up through make. For this reason, both have been moved within the build folder -- so that they are removed when the build folder itself is removed.
This is fine for the crypto header, since it's only necessary when compiling the crypto libraries -- other sources do not need to include it.

Second, the root certificate is always built into the crypto library by default, thereby simplifying the code.
