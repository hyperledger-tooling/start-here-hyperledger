                This PR bumps the WAMR release version up to the latest. Since the last WAMR release used (WAMR-04-15-2021), the latest WAMR releases provide enhancements and bug fixes for AoT compilation, as well as improvements to WAMR's use of WASI APIs and multithreading features.

PDO contract writers and PDO hosts should not expect any differences in functionality or usage of PDO with this upgrade.
