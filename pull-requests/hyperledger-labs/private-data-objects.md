                This PR removes the machinery for configuring the IAS root certificate at build time, and moves the task to the crypto cmake.

Two notes.

First, the artifacts -- namely the IAS root certificate and the crypto header which embeds the certificate itself -- are now generated by cmake itself, and they are not cleaned up through make. For this reason, both have been moved within the build folder -- so that they are removed when the build folder itself is removed.
This is fine for the crypto header, since it's only necessary when compiling the crypto libraries -- other sources do not need to include it.

Second, the root certificate is always built into the crypto library by default, thereby simplifying the code.

                This PR replaces the deprecated python .egg package format for the eservice and pservice with the python .whl format. This is achieved by using more recent python build and install tooling.
