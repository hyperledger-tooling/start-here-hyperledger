                This has various updates related to the "resolve" functionality, including for DID document metadata.

It also updates the "resolver-service" functionality, which makes it possible to run did:keri and did:webs drivers for the Universal Resolver.

This is the state of the code that was used for IIW37 and this tutorial: https://github.com/peacekeeper/did-webs-iiw37-tutorial
