                This PR refactors the identity service to bring clarity to the concepts of Long-Term identity, Identity Provider, Role, and Wallet.

A long-term identity is an identity that carries a long-term unique identifier. 
Long-term identities are grouped in roles. The Token-SDK supports 4 roles: Issuers, Owners, Auditors, and Certifiers.
The Identity Provider manages long-term identities.
A wallet is bound to a long-term identity and manages its pseudonyms and tokens. 
A wallet registry manages all wallets for a given role.

                This PR improves the compatibility with postgres by fixing some bugs encountered while running a token sdk application:

-`identity_id` has non-utf8 characters which is not supported in a `TEXT` column by postgres.
- `raw` cannot be the primary key for params if the params are too large. This PR changes the primary key to the time stored in the database, which is also unique.
- postgres does not have `ON CONFLICT REPLACE` on columns
- the 'restore auditor db' feature was doing writes while iterating over the dbentries, which causes a deadlock with a single threaded KVS.
