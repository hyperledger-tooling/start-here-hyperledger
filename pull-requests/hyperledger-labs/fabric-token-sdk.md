<p>The only major, potentially disruptive change in this release is a bump to Go 1.18.</p>

<h2>v0.18.0</h2>
<p>go-ipld-prime's release policy says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even numbers should be easy upgrades; odd numbers may change things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as an even number, this v0.18.0 release should be a smooth ride for upgraders from v0.17.0. We have 3 major feature additions, all focused on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/node/bindnode">Bindnode</a>.</p>
<h4>ðŸ”¦ Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bindnode</strong>: <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/414">Custom Go type converters</a> - Bindnode performs bidirectional mapping of Go types to the IPLD Data Model, and in doing so, it assumes a straightforward mapping of values to their encoded forms. But there are common cases where a Go type doesn't have a straightforward path to serialization, either because the encoded form needs a custom layout, or because bindnode doesn't have enough information to infer a serialization pattern. Custom Go type converters for bindnode allow a user to supply a pair of converter functions for a Go type that dictate how to map that type to an IPLD Data Model kind. See the <strong><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/node/bindnode">bindnode documentation</a></strong> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Bindnode</strong>: <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/437">Type registry</a> - Setting up Go type mappings with Bindnode involves some boilerplate. A basic type registry is now available that takes some of this boilerplate away; giving you a single place to register, and perform conversions to and from Go types, Data Model (<code>Node</code>) forms or directly through serialization. See the <strong><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/node/bindnode/registry">bindnode/registry documentation</a></strong> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Bindnode</strong>: <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/414/commits/87211682cb963ef1c98fa63909f67a8b02d1108c">Full <code>uint64</code> support</a> - the <code>uint64</code> support introduced in go-ipld-prime@v0.17.0 has been wired into Bindnode. The Data Model (<code>Node</code>) forms expose integers as <code>int64</code> values, which is lossy for unsigned 64-bit integers. Bindnode Go types using <code>uint64</code> values are now lossless in round-trips through serialization to codecs that support the full range (DAG-CBOR most notably).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see all of these new features in action using Filecoin Go types, allowing a mapping between Go types, Data Model (<code>Node</code>) forms, and their DAG-CBOR serialized forms with <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/filecoin-project/go-fil-markets/pull/713">data-transfer vouchers</a>. These features also allow us to interact with the original Go types, without modification, including <code>big.Int</code> serialization to <code>Bytes</code>, Filecoin <code>Signature</code> serialization to a byte-prefix discriminated <code>Bytes</code> and more. Since the Go types are unchanged, they can also simultaneously support <a href="https://github.com/whyrusleeping/cbor-gen">cbor-gen</a> serialization, allowing an easier migration path.</p>
<h2>v0.17.0</h2>
<p><strong>go-ipld-prime</strong>'s release policy says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even numbers should be easy upgrades; odd numbers may change things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that spirit, this v0.17.0 release includes some potentially breaking changes. Although minor, they are marked below and they may lead to behavioral changes in your use of this library.</p>
<h4>ðŸ›  Breaking Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Codecs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>DAG-CBOR, DAG-JSON: <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/433">Error on <code>cid.Undef</code> links in dag{json,cbor} encoding</a> - previously, encoding Link nodes that were empty CIDs (uninitialized zero-value or explicitly <code>cid.Undef</code>) would have passed through the DAG-CBOR or DAG-JSON codecs, silently producing erroneous output that wouldn't successfully pass back through a decode. (Rod Vagg)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bindnode</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/427">Panic early if API has been passed ptr-to-ptr</a> - previous usage of bindnode using pointers-to-pointers may have deferred (or in some cases avoided) panics until deeper usage of the API, this change makes it earlier to make it clear that pointer-to-pointer is not appropriate usage. (Rod Vagg)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/394">Drop Go 1.16.x testing &amp; begin testing Go 1.18.x</a> (Daniel MartÃ­)</li>
<li>Note also that in this release, the <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-cid">github.com/ipfs/<strong>go-cid</strong></a> dependency is upgraded from 0.0.4 to 0.2.0 which includes a breaking change with the removal of the <code>cid.Codecs</code> and <code>cid.CodecToStr</code> maps which may disruptive. See <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-cid/releases/tag/v0.2.0">the go-cid@0.2.0 release page for details</a>.</li>
