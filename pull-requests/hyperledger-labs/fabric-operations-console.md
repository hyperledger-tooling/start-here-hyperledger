#### Description
It's possible to create a blank pending channel tile by creating a real tile, and then canceling the create channel wizard right after starting it. This PR prevents any blank pending channel tiles.

- Bug fix

#### Description
Filtering out msps in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operations-console/pull/264  (for the create channel wizard) was the wrong approach.

What we really needed was a warning/error if the user had not selected any MSPs with a known orderer. So with this PR you can select any MSP you want, as long as 1 or more of them have orderers.

This prevents the error we are trying to stop where a user selects MSPs with 0 orderers && leaves the consenter step as `default` and we create a problematic genesis block since it has 0 consenters.
