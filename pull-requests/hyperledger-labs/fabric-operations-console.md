- Improvement


#### Description
we will now use [owasp-password-strength-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/owasp-password-strength-test) to validate passwords. This is the config using default settings:

```
{
      allowPassphrases       : true,
      maxLength              : 128,
      minLength              : 10,
      minPhraseLength        : 20,
      minOptionalTestsToPass : 4,
}
```
this changes:
- passwords must be 10 characters long instead of 8 (can still be overridden with setting)
- passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- passwords cannot contain sequences of three or more repeated characters
- passphrases can be used which are 20+ characters long
  - passphrases do not need extra complexity like uppercase/lowercase etc
