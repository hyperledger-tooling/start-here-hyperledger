Open for feedback. Experiment with local examples with generated docker configurations.

https://nickel-lang.org/ is used to generate all `compose.yaml` in each example.

|example|description|
|-|-|
|`st`|single-tenant configuration without external services (except database)|
|`st-multi`|3 instances of single-tenant configuration|
|`st-vault`|single-tenant with Vault for secret storage|
|`mt`|multi-tenant configuration using built-in IAM|
|`mt-keycloak`|multi-tenant configuration using Keycloak for IAM|
|`mt-keycloak-vault`|multi-tenant configuration using Keycloak and Vault|

Example we might consider in the future
- vault with file storage
- vault with AppRole authentication
- keycloak with agent `admin` role
- oidc4vc configuration
- overriding config with `application.conf`
- production?

                ### Description: 

This PR undoes the edit of the migration that was introduced in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/open-enterprise-agent/pull/934,  and instead creates a new migration that archives the same state in the DB. Essentially after introducing this change the state of the database will be the same as previously, but with this change, we are not editing migration that was already applied in the SIT environment, which will make the deployment easier.

P.S The tables that the second migration is editing (which were created by the first migration) will be empty 100%, so there is no need to worry about retaining data in this case.

### Alternatives Considered (optional): 
Alternatively, we can either clean the database on prod and re-run the migrations, or edit the table manually because migration V16 won't run again on prod, since it has already been applied.
