<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->

The release process is using `sbt-license` plugin which uses ivy under the hood to resolve dependencies. Ivy isn't happy about the `resteasy-*` dependencies which is a transitive dependencies of `keycloak-admin-client` which is included by `keycloak-test-containers`. Ivy was unable to resolve those and it has to be explicitly defined or somehow partially include this [dependencies BOM](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/blob/main/resteasy-dependencies-bom/pom.xml) .

This is a workaround to unblock the release process (`sbt dumpLicenseReportAggregate`) and should be fixed in a more maintainable way.
