Open for feedback. Experiment with local examples with generated docker configurations.

https://nickel-lang.org/ is used to generate all `compose.yaml` in each example.

|example|description|
|-|-|
|`st`|single-tenant configuration without external services (except database)|
|`st-multi`|3 instances of single-tenant configuration|
|`st-vault`|single-tenant with Vault for secret storage|
|`mt`|multi-tenant configuration using built-in IAM|
|`mt-keycloak`|multi-tenant configuration using Keycloak for IAM|
|`mt-keycloak-vault`|multi-tenant configuration using Keycloak and Vault|

Example we might consider in the future
- vault with file storage
- vault with AppRole authentication
- keycloak with agent `admin` role
- oidc4vc configuration
- overriding config with `application.conf`
- production?
