<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->

We start to have environment variables that shouldn't work in some permutation. It is slightly confusing to user when those are conflicting each other. This PR add some sanity check for the config and stops the Agent from starting with an error message.
