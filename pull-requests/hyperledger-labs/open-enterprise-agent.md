<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->

Previously, the helm-chart for deploying the agent always enabled Cross Origin Resource Sharing with a wildcard pattern - which is not a secure default

Now, the helm-chart defaults to a secure (fail securely principle) setting. This means if the user forgets to set this property - the agent is deployed securely

Impact of this change: environments which do not currently set this property that are used for development or are deployed with a need for applications being developed to access resources accross domains - the following values settings need to be added

```
ingress:
   cors:
      enabled: true
      allow_origins: "domain-to-allow.com"
```

Multiple domains can be specified using `,` as a seperator 
A `*` can be used to signal any domain
