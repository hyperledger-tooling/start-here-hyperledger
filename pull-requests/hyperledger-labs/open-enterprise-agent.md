<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->

This PR fixes all perforrmance tests currently part of the k6 code base. Previously - some didn't work due to issues with the json() serialisation function and there was inconsitency in scenarios and thresholds.
Now - all tests run and pass on a local testing stack (will commit this in a future PR) and use the same defaults for a smoke test

The performance tests have been refactored to share a common scenario but have their own group level thresholds defined. These are just initial definitions and the thresholds have not been tuned with respect to real levels of performance.

Also, this PR introduces a local docker-compose example for running a single tenant stack - with 3 agents - all sharing a single instance of PRISM Node [VDR] 

Two scripts are included for easily running the local e2e tests as well as performance tests.

The performance tests expect a local prometheus instance to be running to push metrics to but will fail gracefully [and run tests anyone] even if it can't push metrics to this local instance of prometheus

# Overview
Fixes ATL-5773
Previously, background jobs would iterate through each wallet and then query the databases correspondingly for each one. This approach may present performance issues as the number of wallets increases. To address this, the background jobs are now executed as an administrator user, and the wallet context is constructed based on each individual record.

                # Overview
<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->
Jira link: ATL-5415

Previously, the helm-chart for deploying the agent always enabled Cross Origin Resource Sharing with a wildcard pattern - which is not a secure default

Now, the helm-chart defaults to a secure (fail securely principle) setting. This means if the user forgets to set this property - the agent is deployed securely

Impact of this change: environments which do not currently set this property that are used for development or are deployed with a need for applications being developed to access resources accross domains - the following values settings need to be added

```
ingress:
   cors:
      enabled: true
      allow_origins: "domain-to-allow.com"
```

Multiple domains can be specified using `,` as a seperator 
A `*` can be used to signal any domain
