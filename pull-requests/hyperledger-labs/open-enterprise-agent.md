<!-- What this PR does, and why is needed, a useful description is expected, and relevant tickets should be mentioned -->

Previous to this PR, when using ZIO HTTP RC2 - we saw a very long delay when making HTTP requests (>2 seconds for each request) - we identified that this was not only an issue with the version of ZIO HTTP we were using but also how it was managing and shuting down the ZIO HTTP stack - essentially every request was starting and stopping the full stack.

After, with upgrading to ZIO HTTP RC4 and refactoring the ZIO layer composition for scope and client, we now see requests completing within 100 ms as the full stack doens't shutdown with every request

Also included in this PR are several improvements to the performance testing framework for error handling when polling background jobs and for managing exceptions when deserialising JSON - previously, any exception thrown was not counted as a failure in the test execution and dropped - now - metrics are available for when the background job does not complete a state transition within the given number of polls 

Fixes ATL-6318
