# Pull Request Checklist

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes. Please make sure that you tick all _appropriate_ boxes. But please read our [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at least once; it will save you a few review cycles!

If an item doesn't apply to your pull request, **check it anyway** to make it apparent that there's nothing to do.

- [x] All commits contain a DCO `Signed-off-by` line (we use the [DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce this).
- [ ] Updated LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.md for any added dependencies or vendored components.
- [ ] Added **tests** for changed code (run `scripts/preflight` to run tests and check code style).
- [ ] Prefixed code comments with GitHub nick and an appropriate prefix.
- [x] Coding style is consistent with the rest of the framework.
- [ ] Updated **documentation** for changed code and new or modified features.

If you have _any_ questions to _any_ of the points above, just **submit and ask**! This checklist is here to _help_ you, not to deter you from contributing!
