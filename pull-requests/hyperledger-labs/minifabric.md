                User can now deploy nodes with a new deploynodes operation. The user must first place their node manifest files into the vars/nodespecs directory before deploying. The operation will search for CA manifest files and deploy those first before deploying the other nodes. 

Also adds missing help messages for deployoperator operation and --target-environment option.
