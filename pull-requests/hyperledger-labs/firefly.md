                - Public URL
    - Adds config option for cases where the listener address (such as `0.0.0.0`) is not the same as the URL that should be used externally for FireFly.
    - This affects the Swagger UI, which needs to perform an call from the browser to download the Swagger YAML.
- File logging
    - Uses lumberjack writer
    - Adds following config options:
    - `log.filename` - filename to log to
    - `log.maxAge` - maximum age before rotating
    - `log.maxSize` - maximum size
    - `log.maxBackups` - maximum number of files to keep
    - `log.compress` - whether to compress the backups

                Currently if you send an unpinned message, it is correctly marked `pending: false` (with a confirmed timestamp) on the receiving node(s), but the sending node leaves it forever in a `pending` state on the sender.
This means in the UI, all the requests are shown _before_ the replies ðŸ™ƒ 

The problem was the unpinned send code was setting `pending` and `confirmed` _before_ sealing the message, which then reset those back to default.

                - Adds a transport wrapper to DX messages, to allow different payloads with efficient deserialization
- Allows an individual unpinned message and data array to be sent, as well as pinned batches
- Adds the group to the private send, so it can be created on the far side
  - The sending side (only) still does a groupinit pinned to the chain, but it's completely async to the private exchanges
- Requires the transaction type of that message to be `none` and the sender to be valid
- Immediately confirms the message and triggers the event
- E2E test included
