                Provides a simple Helm chart for deploying FireFly Core and DX. Features simple options for templating the `firefly.core` config as a `Secret`, as well as more open-ended overrides for future plugins, more complicated scenarios, etc.

DX can have mTLS certificate autogenerated and managed via [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) for simplicity.

Includes a GHA workflow that uses [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) and [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for chart linting and "integration" testing i.e. do pods get installed and come up.

# TODOs
- [x] Get integration test passing
- [x] Liveness / readiness probes
- [x] Log level options
- Follow-up Issues
  - [ ] Proper chart packaging and releases via GH Pages
  - [ ] Open-ended question for docs / automation around blockchain initialization and contracts
  - [ ] Init containers for ensuring each plugin interface is up i.e. Postgres, ethconnect, dx, IPFS
- Docs
  - [x] README.md
  - [x] templates/NOTES.txt
  - [x] Comments in values.yaml
