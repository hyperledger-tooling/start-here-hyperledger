                - Public URL
    - Adds config option for cases where the listener address (such as `0.0.0.0`) is not the same as the URL that should be used externally for FireFly.
    - This affects the Swagger UI, which needs to perform an call from the browser to download the Swagger YAML.
- File logging
    - Uses lumberjack writer
    - Adds following config options:
    - `log.filename` - filename to log to
    - `log.maxAge` - maximum age before rotating
    - `log.maxSize` - maximum size
    - `log.maxBackups` - maximum number of files to keep
    - `log.compress` - whether to compress the backups

                Currently if you send an unpinned message, it is correctly marked `pending: false` (with a confirmed timestamp) on the receiving node(s), but the sending node leaves it forever in a `pending` state on the sender.
This means in the UI, all the requests are shown _before_ the replies ðŸ™ƒ 

The problem was the unpinned send code was setting `pending` and `confirmed` _before_ sealing the message, which then reset those back to default.

                - Adds a transport wrapper to DX messages, to allow different payloads with efficient deserialization
- Allows an individual unpinned message and data array to be sent, as well as pinned batches
- Adds the group to the private send, so it can be created on the far side
  - The sending side (only) still does a groupinit pinned to the chain, but it's completely async to the private exchanges
- Requires the transaction type of that message to be `none` and the sender to be valid
- Immediately confirms the message and triggers the event
- E2E test included

- Adds a new `webhooks` event transport
- Add plugin option to add custom documented options to subscriptions
- Add plugin interface to send replies
- Additional base option added as follows for subscription:

  - `reply` (boolean) - whether to reply
  - `replytag` (string) - the `tag` to use in the reply message
  - `fastack` (boolean) - when true does not wait for HTTP call to complete to ack (meaning parallelism)
  - `url` (string) - the URL to call
  - `method` (string) - the HTTP method to invoke
  - `json` (boolean) - whether to assume the response is JSON, even if the content-type is not set
    - Non-JSON payloads are returned as base64, as per the e2e test
  - `headers` (map string->string) - static headers to set on the request
  - `query` (map string->string) - static query params to set on the request
  - `input.query` (string) - field to reference on the first JSON data in the input message event, to add query params
  - `input.headers` (string) - field to reference on the first JSON data in the input message event, to add headers
  -  `input.body` (string) - field to reference on the first JSON data to be the data
- Includes diagnosis/fix for PSQL constraint issue in #90
