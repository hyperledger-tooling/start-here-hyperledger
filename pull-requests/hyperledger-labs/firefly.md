                Provides a simple Helm chart for deploying FireFly Core and DX. Features simple options for templating the `firefly.core` config as a `Secret`, as well as more open-ended overrides for future plugins, more complicated scenarios, etc.

DX can have mTLS certificate autogenerated and managed via [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) for simplicity.

Includes a GHA workflow that uses [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) and [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for chart linting and "integration" testing i.e. do pods get installed and come up.

# TODOs
- [x] Get integration test passing
- [x] Liveness / readiness probes
- [x] Log level options
- Follow-up Issues
  - [ ] Proper chart packaging and releases via GH Pages
  - [ ] Open-ended question for docs / automation around blockchain initialization and contracts
  - [ ] Init containers for ensuring each plugin interface is up i.e. Postgres, ethconnect, dx, IPFS
- Docs
  - [x] README.md
  - [x] templates/NOTES.txt
  - [x] Comments in values.yaml

                An attempt at a set of docs that are sufficient for getting started:
- Key concepts - high level information and diagrams:
  - Multi-party systems
  - FireFly problem statement
  - The FireFly node
  - Blockchain protocols
  - Deterministic compute
  - Private data exchange
  - Broadcast / shared data
  - Multi-party process flow
- Getting Started - JSON snippets and step by step instructions:
  - Install the FireFly CLI
  - Start your environment
  - Run a sample
  - Privately send data
  - Broadcast data
  - Explore messages
  - Listen for events
  - Define a datatype

A bunch more to do, and there are some intentional teasers there with WIP pointing at big bits that are under development (like Tokens, and custom on-chain transactions).

Next steps in my mind on the docs are:
- Add the Request/Reply messaging & Webhooks info from #81 
- Start to fill out the `Reference` section - particularly for:
  - Options around events
  - Details of how different hashes in the system are generated

Additoinal:
- Some improvements to images (using SVGs and adding a click through to full-screen)
- Small tweak to the Swagger generation (it was showing URL with `/api/v1/api/v1` duplicated).
- Correct `batchID` to `batch` on the API for messages - fyi @shorsher
