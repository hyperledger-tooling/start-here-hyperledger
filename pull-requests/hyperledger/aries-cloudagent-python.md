Additional tests for multi-credential proofs with a mix of revocable and non-revocable credentials

These tests pass:
- @T003-RFC0454.1 - two credentials, one revocable one not, neither revoked, "non_revoked" is requested at the attribute level
- @T003-RFC0454.2 - two credentials, one revocable one not, one revoked, proof checks for revocation (attribute level) and fails
- @T003-RFC0454.3 - two credentials, one revocable one not, one revoked, proof *doesn't* check for revocation (attribute level) and passes

This test "fails" - the proof doesn't verify even though it should:
- @T003-RFC0454.1f - two credentials, one revocable one not, neither revoked, "non_revoked" is requested at the*request* level

For the failing scenario, it fails with indy-sdk and credx.  I believe  the underlying library is not creating the proof properly, and/or the underlying anoncreds itself has a bug.

                Fix python-indy version restrictions format.

Previous format was breaking for poetry-based builds: `Invalid constraint (python3-indy (>=1.11.1<2) ; extra == 'indy') found in aries-cloudagent-1.0.0rc1 dependencies, skipping`

Version restrictions are supposed to be conformant to: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-specifiers
