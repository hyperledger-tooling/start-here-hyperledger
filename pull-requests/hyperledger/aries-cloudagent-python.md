                As a group of university students we implemented the protocols issue_credential and present_proof for DIDComm v2. The encryption is currently still the same as for DIDComm v1.â€¨ In addition to the tests of v3, the new endpoints can be tested using a DIDComm v1 connection for now. As soon as there is a decision on how to implement/extend the existing connection for DIDComm v2, the intention is to implement it and use its information regarding the DIDComm version for choosing the encryption type (and in case of DIDComm v2 to use the encryption which is already implemented in the askar wallet).
