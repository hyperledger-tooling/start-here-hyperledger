Added/enabled 2 tests to use the updated endpoints
- [Issue a credential with the Issuer beginning with an offer](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/2565fe84e2716fcda44a3b1bb32095e9c6fd62bd/demo/features/0453-issue-credential.feature#L40)

Have not included revocation yet, just want to get feedback before doing more work. A little concerned that there appears to be a lot more logic in the `/schemas` and `credential-definitions` endpoints than in `anoncreds`.  Granted, the `anoncreds` endpoints are more service oriented and have the services doing a lot of the work that is buried in routes... however, I'm not finding much about where the endorser fits in? Does that work still need to be done in `anoncreds`, I think the multi-ledger came after we split, but that needs addressing to - correct?

                This issue resolves #2250

Here I have created a GitHub workflow that will execute the tests just as they are handled in `nightly-tests.yml` excluding the indy tests as mentioned in this comment.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/2250#issuecomment-1674918887

The workflow acts as follows
```python
run nightly tests
If (tests are successful):
   build a nightly release
   publish this release with the `nightly` tag
```

                This is a rebased version of #2033. Thank you for your contributions, @Przytua!

I think these changes are likely to be better suited to a new endpoint (i.e. `POST /present-proof/{pres_ex_id}/counter-request` or something) rather than changing the behavior of `POST /present-proof/{pres_ex_id}/request`. I'll open this as a draft for now and look at making these changes when I can.

                As a consequence of the fix in #2223, events/webhooks for new connections created responding to multi-use invitations were not being emitted. This happened because events are emitted, unless specified with the appropriate flag, only when the connection record being saved is new OR the state has changed.

Neither of those conditions is true for a multi-use invitation since the record is "cloned" and contextually set to state `request`  (see #2099). 

The fix ensures an event (and webhook) is always emitted when a new connection transitions to the `request` state.

                Add BDD tests for issue v2 and proof presentation v2.
The tests include create schema, create cred def and revocation through the new `/anoncreds` API.

Note that I encountered some weirdness running the tests in the devcontainer... some messages didn't appear to be fully fleshed out (see comments about "by_format"). Running using the `run_bdd` script was fine.

Also, on proof presentation, I could not get it working using restriction with "schema_name" and "schema_version" like other presentations. I used restrictions by `cred_def_id` to pass the tests.  Not sure if that is something that needs to be looked at further as it would impact migrations to `anoncreds` if current presentation requests don't work.
