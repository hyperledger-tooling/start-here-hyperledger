                Adds a couple of options:

Author can specify to auto-promote DID to their public DID when they receive the endorsed transaction (and it is saved)

Endorser can use a different DID for endorsing than they use for their public DID (for connections) (can be specified globally by parameter, or can be specified when they call the endorse endpoint).
