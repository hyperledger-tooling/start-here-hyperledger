(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised.




Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.


Check the changes in this PR to ensure they won't cause issues with your project.

            taa_acceptance = await self.get_latest_txn_author_acceptance()
            if "mechanism" not in taa_acceptance:
                return True
        return self.read_only
```

To make this clearer to the user, I updated the relevant error messages to say TAA  may also be the cause of the LedgerError.

e.g.:
```py
                raise LedgerError(
                    "Error cannot write cred def when ledger is in read only mode, "
                    "or TAA is required and not accepted"
                )
```
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
