                Connection responses associated with an invite that was created with mediation were not properly reporting the mediators endpoint and keys when automatically sent after receiving a connection request. This PR fixes this issue and also does some minor code clean up.

                Now that `their_public_did` is saved as a tag (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1543), we can use it to filter connections made with a specific public did.

This PR adds the filter option to the get all connections endpoint. Same as with #1453, this will only work for connections made after PR #1453 was merged or if the upgrade command has been run
