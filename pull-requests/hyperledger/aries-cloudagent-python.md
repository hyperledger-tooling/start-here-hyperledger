                I'm not sure what happened -- or perhaps I'm just imagining that it was in our dev deps before -- but black wasn't in our pyproject.toml so I added it back in. And associated lock update.

                    feat: add timeout to did resolver resolve method

                This PR adds a `timeout` parameter to the DID Resolver interface, defaulting to 30 seconds. Without it, a poorly behaved resolver plugin can "resolve" documents that aren't actually DID Docs and cause ACA-Py to run out of memory.

There's space for additional tuning on the timeout default. Some DID Methods are, in my experience, quite slow (did:btcr and did:ion resolvers can be pretty slow sometimes). 30 seconds might be overly charitable.

                Still in infancy, having troubles mapping anoncreds-rs to current revocation API.
See issue #2432.

Next step is to work on the BDD tests in `0586-sign-transaction.feature`, enable those and get those working. Perhaps should have started there earlier and would have given me a more focused path forward. ðŸ¤·
