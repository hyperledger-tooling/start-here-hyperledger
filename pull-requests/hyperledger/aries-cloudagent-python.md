                    feat: enable creation of DIDs for all registered methods

                Here're a couple of changes leveraging the recent addition of the `DIDMethods` registry.
The aim is to allow agents using DID methods defined in plugin to create DIDs without implementing method-specific endpoints if not necessary.

Changes:
   * Relax condition on did format for the `POST /wallet/did` endpoint
   * Validate new DIDs parameters using `DIDMethods` in Askar and InMemory profiles
      validate new DIDs parameters
   * Factorize some validation code

Notes:
   * A lot of tests are impacted by the change, if anybody has a suggestion for a quick solution to avoid that...
   * It would be nice to implement the DID derivation in each `DIDMethod` but this would require quite some work to be able to remove the did:sov and did:key initialization hardcoded in `DIDMethods`.
