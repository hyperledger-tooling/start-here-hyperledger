                ## What is this PR for?

Currently, the issuer only has the ability to offer a credential that is the same as the one defined in a credential proposal. 
This PR enables the holder and issuer to negotiate about the credential via proposals and offers in order to agree on what credential the holder will receive.

### Backwards compatibility:

If the counter-offer is not defined/empty logic stays the same as It was before this change.
