Added startup and shutdown event notifications

This PR is W.I.P. but opening up for visibility

@TimoGlastra  this adds startup/shutdown notifications (as discussed on RocketChat I think?), let me know if this is what you were thinking.  This is for the base wallet but assume we need something similar for sub-wallets?
