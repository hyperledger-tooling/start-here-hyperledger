                Resolves #2430.

This PR removes the old deprecated routing protocol messages pertaining to coordinating a "route" with another connection. This functionality was superseded by the coordinate mediation protocol. It's been well over two years since it was superseded so this PR is just taking care of the clean up that probably ought to have been done a while ago.

In this PR you will see:

- Messages and handlers for route queries and updates have been removed
- Methods on the route manager to facilitate route updates have been removed
- The Coordinate Mediation Manager now directly implements logic for performing route updates. It was previously borrowing this logic from the route manager.
- Route related code has been removed from the connection manager and connection record. This was done in such a way that the `routing_state` in the wallet records will still be accepted but will (continue to) be unused.
- The `RouteManager` continues to exist and is used to manage creation of route records. Its responsibilities are now appropriately narrowed to this. It is used by the MediationManager and MultitenancyManager to track routes.

                I'm not sure what happened -- or perhaps I'm just imagining that it was in our dev deps before -- but black wasn't in our pyproject.toml so I added it back in. And associated lock update.

                    feat: add timeout to did resolver resolve method

                This PR adds a `timeout` parameter to the DID Resolver interface, defaulting to 30 seconds. Without it, a poorly behaved resolver plugin can "resolve" documents that aren't actually DID Docs and cause ACA-Py to run out of memory.

There's space for additional tuning on the timeout default. Some DID Methods are, in my experience, quite slow (did:btcr and did:ion resolvers can be pretty slow sometimes). 30 seconds might be overly charitable.

                Still in infancy, having troubles mapping anoncreds-rs to current revocation API.
See issue #2432.

Next step is to work on the BDD tests in `0586-sign-transaction.feature`, enable those and get those working. Perhaps should have started there earlier and would have given me a more focused path forward. ðŸ¤·
