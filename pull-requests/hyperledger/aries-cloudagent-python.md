                Updates necessary to create a 0.8.0-rc0 release. For this release, the CHANGELOG.md has been update to move the categorized list of Pull Requests from the "0.1.0-rc1" to under this release, and then the PRs since 1.0.0-rc1 were added.

My proposal is that after we release 0.8.0 (final), we follow up with a 0.1.0-rc2 release that is the same as 0.8.0 so that those tracking to the 1.0.0 release can use that. As needed, we can do the same for 0.8.1 / 0.9.0 if needed, but ideally we will get 1.0.0 out the door before those are needed.

@WadeBarnes @ianco @dbluhm -- does that make sense?

Also, please review the note I put into the changelog about the container images (do we have link to put into that paragraph), and if what I state is accurate.

                Fix a small inconsistency between the openapi schema and the actual return value for the `/resolver/resolve/{did}`.

This PR aligns the schema to the actual return value to avoid breaking any current implementation making use of the endpoint.
