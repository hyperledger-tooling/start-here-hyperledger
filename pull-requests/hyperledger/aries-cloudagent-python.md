                    chore: propose official deprecations of a couple of features
                </b>

            </td>
            <td>
                With this PR I'd like to propose that we move the following features to deprecated status:

- Aries RFC 160 Connection Protocol
- `did:sov:...` as Protocol Doc URI

By moving these to deprecated status, we inform the community that these are features that should no longer be used and steer them to DID Exchange and using didcomm.org as the doc uri in their projects.

These items should more or less already be considered deprecated but there are some final efforts that need to be made to tie up loose ends. With the introduction of qualified DIDs in the pending 0.12.0 release and automatically always emitting https://didcomm.org (by setting the flag for it to be permanently set to `true`), we move close enough to these loose ends being tied off to, in my opinion, move these features to official deprecated status.

In practice, this PR affects the code in the following ways:

- Prints a deprecation notice on startup (to stderr) that these features are now deprecated.
- When a message with type starting with `did:sov:` is received, log a deprecation warning
- When a connection protocol operation is taken, log a warning message (this one might be a bit aggressive; I'd be happy to tone this back if it's too much)
- Mark the Admin API endpoints as deprecated in the OpenAPI/Swagger spec and UI. The endpoints are still usable but are greyed out.
  - To clarify, only the Admin API endpoints triggering connection protocol specific operations are marked as deprecated. Other connection management endpoints are NOT marked as deprecated (e.g. listing connections, deleting a connection, etc.).

Let me know your thoughts.

                Fixes: #2817 

DID Exchange was responding incorrectly to requests, sending unqualified DIDs with a `did_rotate~attach` (which is nonsensical). This fixes it to only send a `did_rotate~attach` when the DID associated with the connection is a qualified DID. Additionally, this change also ensures that the webhook for the new connection request will only be emitted after the request has been attached to the connection record. Without this, a race condition can occur for controllers that try to accept the request before ACA-Py finishes storing the request.

As a side note, I left a todo wondering out loud about whether the webhook for the newly created connection record (the one that gets generated from a multi-use connection record) should happen at all.

<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/releases">black's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>24.3.0</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you
run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab
characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503">CVE-2024-21503</a>.</p>
<p>This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make
incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.</p>
<h3>Stable style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4248">#4248</a>)</li>
<li>Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions
of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing
nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until
support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4270">#4270</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected
(<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4273">#4273</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab
characters. This fixes

                1. Added support for building the agent image using 'build'
2. Implemented the ability to start the agent container with 'start' with host files mounted into docker container
3. Updated the script to handle the 'resolution' command with its options(build & run)

Build

<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/releases">psf/black's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>24.3.0</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you
run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab
characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503">CVE-2024-21503</a>.</p>
<p>This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make
incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.</p>
<h3>Stable style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4248">#4248</a>)</li>
<li>Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions
of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing
nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until
support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4270">#4270</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected
(<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4273">#4273</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab
characters. This fixes
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503">CVE-2024-21503</a>.
(<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4278">#4278</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Note what happens when <code>--check</code> is used with <code>--quiet</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4236">#4236</a>)</li>
</ul>
