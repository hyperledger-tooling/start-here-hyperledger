                Hi everyone,

this PR fixes a few problems which were apparently introduced by #1710:

- A didx request which is received in response to an explicit oob invitation cannot be accepted because the state of the corresponding connection record is not updated to `'request-received'`

- The admin api incorrectly indicates that the `/out-of-band/receive-invitation` endpoint returns a `ConnRecord` instead of the new `OobRecord` (which is also why the `OobRecord` is not included in the `swagger.json`)

@TimoGlastra: maybe you want to take a look to make sure I didn't break the connectionless exchange feature by saving the updated connection record?
