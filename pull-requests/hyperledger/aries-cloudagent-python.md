                Adds unit tests for routes, holder, verifier, issuer.

![Screenshot from 2023-12-13 10-50-52](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/assets/31809382/96589ed6-0add-4cef-bc64-66974229eacd)

There is still more unit testing to do. Mainly the `revocation.py` file. Also, there was a tricky part with scanning the wallet in holder and using `async for` I haven't figured out yet. Also there is some error handling I haven't covered. 

I tried to create objects with the `anoncreds` library as much as possible to catch problems in the future when using the library. When I couldn't manage to make that work I would mock the object a minimally as possible. I also had some trouble creating some DB/wallet `Entry` responses. To get around this i created some minimal class objects. These are used in holder and issuer files.

I made 2 small changes to src code. In verifier.py changed an error handling message and in holder.py added the mime-types attribute constant that seemed to be missing.

                This PR addresses  #2669

There is currently a validation that prevents credential with only the base type from being signed. The data model spec states that additional credential types are optional. This also prevents conforming to some test-suites where [single credential type](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model-2.0-test-suite/blob/main/tests/input/credential-ok.json) credentials are used as test data.

This is a minor change with no impact.

                Not all cases on issue credential (v1 and v2) were respecting the system default. 

There was a bug on issue credential v1 where `auto_remove` flag was set then ignored before the record was saved.


So behaviour has been tested for issue credential (v1 & v2) and proof presentation (v1 & v2); exchange records are preserved if the `--preserve-exchange-records` is `true` and `auto_remove` has not been set to `True` on API calls that accept it (ie `send-offer`, `send-request`).

Fixes #2656

                Link to image is broken after [RFCs PR#703](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/703) which renamed the "master" branch to "main". It appears that other references (tree, blob) redirect from the URL containing "master" to the equivalent with "main", but URLs with "raw" do not(â€½).
