                @Moopli had an interop issue between AFGO and ACA-Py. It came down to ACA-Py modifying the json returned from an attachment decorator which would cause issues later on because the object was missing some expected properties. (see more info below)

To prevent such mistakes in the future it is now fixed by making a deep copy both when setting and retrieving json from an attachment decorator. I'm not 100% what the impact of this is on performance, and whether json.dumps and json.loads may be faster.

We could also fix it by making a copy in the json ld handler, but this won't fix the issue all together. @andrewwhitehead I'm interested to hear which approach you'd take.

> TimoGlastra I found the bug
from here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/aries_cloudagent/protocols/issue_credential/v2_0/manager.py#L571
we end up calling ld_proof/handler LDProofCredFormatHandler.receive_credential, and when it gets here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/aries_cloudagent/protocols/issue_credential/v2_0/formats/ld_proof/handler.py#L493
it modifies the original attachment in the message, removing the proof member from the credential. So when the ld proof handler returns, V20CredManager stores the damaged message, causing the later error on deserialization.
The issue is, AttachDecorator returns json attachments by reference: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/aries_cloudagent/messaging/decorators/attach_decorator.py#L560
To fix this issue alone, LDProofCredFormatHandler.receive_credential could simply build a shallow copy of cred_dict
but I imagine that where one bug appears, others lurk in silence - is AttachDecorator` supposed to provide a mutable reference? Or should it return a deep copy of the dict?
the workaround I'm doing right now is to make the issued credential a b64 attachment instead

                    Refactor outbound queue interface

                This PR adjusts the outbound queue interface to be more easily generalized. As we've worked to implement outbound queuing via Kafka, we've found that the configuration just did not map onto what was needed in Kafka. Rather than expecting a connection string and parsing protocol etc. etc., this PR just passes all settings to the outbound queue implementation and allows it to read plugin configuration from the settings. This affords much greater flexibility in the structure of the outbound queue implementation. As a result, I removed some outbound queue command line arguments that were no longer used.

Additionally, I updated aioredis to 2.0.0. From the aioredis maintainers speaking on version 1.3.1 of the library:

> As of December, 2019, this library had been abandoned. The code had grown stale, issues were piling up, and we were rapidly becoming out-of-date with Redisâ€™s own feature-set. In light of this, the decision was made to ensure that the barrier to support for potential maintainers or contributors would be minimized.

I found that using aioredis 2.0.0 significantly simplified the code as it stood.

Some other minor consistency fixes were made to bring the outbound queue package in line with the rest of the code base.

I haven't had an opportunity to integration test the redis changes just yet. I noticed there were some tests for this but they did not appear to be run anywhere in the tests run by the github actions. Is this something we would want run as part of PR checks or is the occasional one-off sufficient?
