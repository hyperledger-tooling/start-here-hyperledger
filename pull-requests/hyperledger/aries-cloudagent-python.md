                We found out that the `offers_attach` attribute is not present in the credential offer schema. It is possible to send it to the api but its not present in the openapi spec. This is a problem is you generate yourself a client with the openapi spec because offers_attach is not defined.

This pr adds the attribute to the credential offer schemas.
It seems that there were also some other changes that are not reflected in the openapi.json. Therefore the changes in the openapi spec are bigger than the real changes in this pr.

                There is a ToDo note talking about sending webhooks when records are deleted. There are also no webhooks that get sent when a credential is deleted. This PR aims to fix the ToDo, as well as provide webhooks for when a credential has been deleted.
