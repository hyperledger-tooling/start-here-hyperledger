                This PR does a radical reorganization of the documents in the ACA-Py repository. The following is a summary of the changes:

- Most Markdown files in the root have been moved to the docs folder, and organized into folders that match those used on the [https://aca-py.org](https://aca-py.org) -- demo, gettingStarted, testing, deploying, etc.
- Expected files -- LICENSE, MAINTAINERS.md, README.md and the like were left in the root folder.
- The MD files in the `demo` folder were moved to `docs/demo' and a new README.md file added pointing to those.
- The previous Getting Started files were moved to the `docs/gettingStarted` folders.
- A pass was done to change all the links found (in a manual pass...) to be relative links and to the new location of the files.
- A pass was done to remove all of the MD lint warnings (other than spelling of ACA-Py/Aries/SSI terms).
- Some cleanup was done to external references -- changing references from greenlight ledger to BCovrin test, eliminating some references to old demos, adding references to the Traction Tutorial.
- New README.md files were needed -- such as in the root of the `docs` folder with pointers to guidance for maintaining both the ReadTheDocs documentation and the [https://aca-py.org](https://aca-py.org) documentation.
- I've not done anything with the ELK Stack MD documents -- will think about what to do with those later (if anything).

Not perfect, but I think it is close.

It is a lot of change. Would appreciate people browsing [my branch](https://github.com/swcurran/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/organize-docs) in the GitHub UI to scan for issues, and report them.  Important things to note are changes that need to be made before we merge this and more general updates that are overdue and needed.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrades pytest-asyncio to latest
‚úÖ fix some test's event loop scopes (also mark some tests requiring askar or bbs)
üéâ  resolves 2154 deprecation warnings
___
Original:
Reviewing test logs show that there are 2154 deprecation warnings coming from across 202 test files, each reporting:
```sh
  /home/runner/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/aries-cloudagent-LQSjsNdA-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytest_asyncio/plugin.py:451: DeprecationWarning: pytest-asyncio detected an unclosed event loop when tearing down the event_loop
  fixture: <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>
  pytest-asyncio will close the event loop for you, but future versions of the
  library will no longer do so. In order to ensure compatibility with future
  versions, please make sure that:
      1. Any custom "event_loop" fixture properly closes the loop after yielding it
      2. The scopes of your custom "event_loop" fixtures do not overlap
      3. Your code does not modify the event loop in async fixtures or tests
```

This indicates that the pytests are not configured correctly, or at least not in an up-to-date way.

These are the current test results after upgrading to the latest pytest-asyncio version

Edit: these new test failures/errors all come down to either pytest scope needing to be a higher level, or tests that should be marked "to skip" (askar or bbs)
