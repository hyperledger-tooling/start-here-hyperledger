                PR to propose making sample in this repo more use-case / demo driven: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-samples/pull/52#issuecomment-1484959925

We already have two repos contains example code of how to talk to a Firefly system using node.js code:
https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-sdk-nodejs/tree/main/examples
https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-sandbox

And as those two repos all contain live code that people use, the code in those repos is more up-to-date than the ones in this sample repo. Therefore, I feel unless we find a distinct purpose that is different from those two repos, it's not going to be a motivating job to maintain code in this repo.

One motivation I feel could work is, we use this repo to record demoable development tasks / use cases. These can be common use cases that we demo to new contributors or web3 developers.

https://github.com/nguyer/global-forum-2022-firefly-workshop is what triggered the thought above ^^ 

@awrichar @nguyer @peterbroadhurst @shorsher @matthew1001 please share your thoughts on this.
