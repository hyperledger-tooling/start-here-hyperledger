### Description of the Change

Changes tend to improve sumeragi message processing speed.

- Fix bug when iroha sleep after role-agnostic message
- Refactor view change proof chain and improve it's processing speed.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Closes #3109.

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Better sumeragi message processing speed.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
 
None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs


There is still problem with: 

```
This peer is faulty. Incoming messages have to be dropped due to low processing speed.
```

This happens because sumeragi blocks on committing/revalidating block and if it takes time greater than `pipeline` `ViewChangeSuggested` start flooding queue. 
When queue is full it's staring to drop messages which in turn provoke even more `ViewChangeSuggested` messages.

                ### Description

Improved sub-routing of the `status` endpoint. 

### Issue

Closes #3099 

### Benefits
#### Routing
One does not need to decode JSON in order to obtain a subset of the data. Specifically this can be used for makeshift healthchecking. 

#### Colour
Additional checks for the standard terminal colour specifications are implemented. Specifically,  if the environment variable 
`TERMINAL_COLORS` is defined and not equal to `false`, and the current `stdout` supports colour (i.e. isn't redirected to a file), additional colour is applied to the `cli` messages. If either of the above is false, terminal colour is disabled. Including logging and panic hooks. 

#### Minor fixes

Running Iroha with a non-existent configuration file no longer directly produces a failure. Instead data is deserialised from the environment and errors from there are forwarded. 

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8180/status/blocks
```

Should return a single number, while 

```sh
curl curl http://127.0.0.1:8180/status
``` 

should return a set of JSON values. 

```sh
NO_COLOR=true cargo run --bin iroha
```

### Issue

Closes #2599 

### Benefits

Smoother toolchain upgrade process

### Possible Drawbacks

New lints have to be explicitly enabled. Migitation:
