                I want to separate the compose files for the supported Iroha versions.

### Requirements

We'll need to update the docs to reflect this.


### Description of the Change

It solves https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/3183, so the users always pick the proper branch.

### Issue

By default, our `docker-compose` files run the `dev` version that tends to break occasionally, while we want them to run either `stable` or `lts`.

### Benefits

This PR will help the users pick the right branch.

### Possible Drawbacks

* I might have missed some configuration features in the `stable` and `lts` versions, so this PR requires extensive testing.
* There are more files in the main directory now.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

`docker compose -f docker-compose-lts.yml`; on the older versions, it will be `docker-compose -f docker-compose-lts.yml`.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

As mentioned by @appetrosyan, we should still consider Nix as a way to install Iroha due to the many advantages of building and deploying the code.

<!-- Optional sections may be omitted. Just remove them or write None -->

<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change
* Augmented `Account` with a dashmap storing asset registering transactions.
* New query to get those transactions.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue
Closes #2097.
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Ease of use and querying for SDK developers.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
* Fatter `Account` structs.
* Concerns about event implications. Now (un)registering an asset emits two events instead of one, and e.g. using `FindError::Asset` to report failing to retrieve a value from the map might be not ideal semantically. 
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs
Does the `AssetDefinition` need the same functionality? I.e. do we want to augment `Domain` with the same kind of map?
<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Description of the Change

Since [Rust 1.68](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/03/09/Rust-1.68.0.html#default-alloc-error-handler) default alloc error handler is stabilized
