                ## Description
1. Substitute `llvm-cov` coverage tool by `grcov` (only `grcov` generates coverage reports that are compatible with Sonarqube).
2. Add jobs and steps into workflows to set up `lcov` and `clippy` reports uploading to Sonarqube and Defectdojo.
3. Bump `actions/checkout` somewhere.
4. Update `Dockerfiles.build`.

### Benefits
iroha2 dev code will be analyzed in Sonarqube and Defectdojo tools. Links to services URL will be provide in DM. It has access via corporate LDAP account.

### Note
It would be much better to send generared `clippy` and `lcov` reports from PR workflow where are they actually are generated. But we can't do it since GitHub actions security policies. So, we might try at least to upload them during pushing to dev branch. Hopefully, `dawidd6/action-download-artifact` has a magic to search for the latest uploaded artifact from the particular workflow.
