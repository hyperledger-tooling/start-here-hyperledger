                ### Description of the Change
1. Modify iroha2 CI in order to enable conditional step of `iroha2-base` image build if its `Dockerfile.base` has been changed.
2. Get back `I2::Dev::Label` workflow since we are able to apply the same approach as for `base-image` build.
3. Remove necessaries iroha2-dev-pr-label-config.yml` and `iroha2-dev-pr-label-api.yml` workflows files.

### Issue
Since `tj-actions/changed-files` and `dorny/paths-filter` Actions doesn't work within `hyperledger/iroha` repository, this is another one possible solution to resolve #2732.

### Benefits
1. Refactoring of iroha2 CI.
2. Reduce the amount of workflows files.

### Possible Drawbacks

### Description of the Change

- Removed logger config from Client config

#### Why remove?

AFAIK Rust libraries are [disallowed](https://crates.io/crates/log#usage) to activate logs by themself. Binaries should enable it. And user should decide if he want to run with logs and with which level of logs.

You can try to create a binary, import `iroha_client` and use something like [`env_logger`](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) to enable logs. Then run your binary with `RUST_LOG=debug` env var. This will enable logs.

We don't have a lot of logs inside our `iroha_client` crate so that you won't see much of them, especially if you are not doing something. But in you can experiment with some methods or insert your logs in `iroha_client` crate manually to see, that it works.

### Benefits

- No more useless config

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### LTS update?

I don't think, that this is an important fix. I just remove what does not work. I don't think we need a PR into `iroha2-lts`, but if you insist, I can do that

### Benefits

1. Publish images
2. The auto-labels works

### Possible Drawbacks

There should be a better way. This is just a stopgap for this release. Could you take over @BAStos525 ?

### Description of the Change
Modify `commit-msg` git hook to enable commits message format checking.

### Issue
It was the request to create  git commits message checking process as it is implemented for Pull Request Title checking.

### Benefits
To add the same policy for commits message format checking as Pull Request Title validation has it. It should help to make a commits message more more structured, readable and organized. I'm not sure if this commits policy should be mandatory for all contributors.

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

### Description of the Change

Rewrite the sumeragi consensus algorithm as a single threaded operation.

#2426 
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Testing needs to qualify this, but it is probably already a lot faster and there is a lot of headroom for optimization still. Many bugs in the consensus may be fixed due to the rewrite.

### Possible Drawbacks

There may be new bugs introduced.
