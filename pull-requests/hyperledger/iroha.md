### Description of the Change
Introduce sending telemetry to substrate-telemetry. There are two messages: the initialization message that indicates the node configuration and the update message that indicates the peers, transactions, blocks.
The telemetry can be configured with the following parameters:
```
"TELEMETRY": {
    "NAME": "Your node's name",
    "URL": "ws://localhost:8001/submit"
}
```

                ### Description

Replaced code duplication in `logger/src/lib.rs` with a monomorphic version of the same. 

Implemented `tracing-bunyan-formatter`. Added tests to see if telemetry behaviour is consistent with 

### Issue

Resolves #1516 and #1497. 

### Benefits

Less code duplication. `Bunyan` export added as a configuration option. 

### Possible Drawbacks

No known performance impact. Slightly slower compilation of the logging crate. 

### Alternate design

Use `Box<dyn Subscriber>` as the return type of `crate::logger::init()`. It reduces code duplication even further at a potential cost of introducing dynamic dispatch into logging.
