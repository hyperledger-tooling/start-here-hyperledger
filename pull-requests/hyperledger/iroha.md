### Description of the Change
Modify `commit-msg` git hook to enable commits message format checking.

### Issue
It was the request to create  git commits message checking process as it is implemented for Pull Request Title checking.

### Benefits
To add the same policy for commits message format checking as Pull Request Title validation has it. It should help to make a commits message more more structured, readable and organized. I'm not sure if this commits policy should be mandatory for all contributors.

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

### Description of the Change

Rewrite the sumeragi consensus algorithm as a single threaded operation.

#2426 
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Testing needs to qualify this, but it is probably already a lot faster and there is a lot of headroom for optimization still. Many bugs in the consensus may be fixed due to the rewrite.

### Possible Drawbacks

There may be new bugs introduced.

1. Export `KURA_BLOCK_STORE_PATH` in docker images
	- Additionally, make it configurable as a build arg
2. Rename `DEFAULT_BLOCK_STORE_PATH` from `./blocks` to `./storage`

### Issue

1. Closes #2700

### Benefits

1. The block storage is available from docker containers without any special configuration
2. Have a default storage name regardless of deployment methods

### Possible Drawbacks

2. The rename can affect documentation. Could you check @outoftardis

### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

- Add `ThreadHandler` struct to shutdown iroha submodules threads on `Iroha` shutdown (RAII).
- Rewrite `Kura` block writing loop: on shutdown `Kura` writes remaining blocks and then exits.
- Add temporary directory to `Peer` struct to delete directory after `Iroha` (and thus `Kura` thread).
