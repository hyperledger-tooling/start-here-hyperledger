### Description of the Change

Linear memory can be limited with `StoreLimits` via `store.limiter` and therefore, importing memory from host wasn't required and would only increase complexity of writing smartcontract for the user

### Issue

closes #1767 

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

As of Wasmtime(0.33.0) the `Trap` returned is that of fuel consumed. I opened an issue with `Wasmtime` to fix that

### Description of the Change

Due to some git-related issues, this PR combines several PRs that would've conflicted or were not available anymore (fully my fault):
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1870 (yet unapproved) - Healthcheck Endpoint
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1741 (approved) - iroha-swarm added to docs
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1778 (approved) - build-fix
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1829 (approved) - RocksDB and Postgres comparison
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1850 (not fully approved) - good migration practice 

### Issue

Closes #1840
Closes #1834

### Benefits

More docs

### Possible Drawbacks

Sorry for combining these changes together

- adds permission validation to wasm runtime
- introduces `TransactionValidator` as a separate structure
- fixes deserialization of `SignaturesOf`
- ensures that `VersionedTransaction` is exchanged between peers instead of `VersionedAcceptedTransaction`
- deduplicates transaction limits in configuration of `torii`/`wasm` vs `sumeragi`

Add a validation to the `Burn<Account, PublicKey>` execution

### Issue
Closes #1848

### Benefits
First-aid for the issue:
- Prevent accidentally burning the last key for the account
- Prevent users from assuming that they can delete the account by burning its last key
  - Direct them to `Unregister<Account>`
### Possible Drawbacks
None

### Alternate Designs
The true solution will be the new account structure #1594 where an account is identified by its public key
