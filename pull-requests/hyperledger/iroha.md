                ## Description

Consider `client.toml`:
```toml
torii_url = "http://iroha-test.com/peer-1/"
```
Currently `/peer-1/` part will be ignored and queries will be send to `http://iroha-test.com/query`. This PR fixes it

### Benefits

Fix using `torii_url` with path in `client.toml`

### Checklist

- [ ] I've read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] I've used the standard signed-off commit format (or will squash just before merging)
- [ ] All applicable CI checks pass (or I promised to make them pass later)
- [ ] (optional) I've written unit tests for the code changes
- [ ] I replied to all comments after code review, marking all implemented changes with thumbs up

## Description

We had some unnecessary dependencies on `iroha_wasm_builder`, blocking the build of iroha cli and client. This PR removes those and makes it so only the `iroha_wasm_builder` cli and integration tests actually depend on the crate.

As a part of this change, `construct_executor` utility function is moved from `iroha_cli` to `test_network`, as it only gets used in tests. Not _entirely_ happy with its new location, but `iroha_cli` is definitely a worse place for this.

### Linked issue

Closes #4882

### Benefits

Hopefully, faster incremental builds in cases when integration tests are not being built.

                ## Description

Added two new config parameters which limits number of live queries (global and per-user). Default value for both is 128. This is needed to prevent high memory usage in cases when client sends a lot of queries with large output, but do not fully consume those queries (that is obtain only first batch and doesn't send requests for the next batches). Normally clients should not do this, but malicious third-party can send such requests to DDOS iroha peer. In case limits are exceeded, iroha peer will return error "429 too many requests" for the query request.

* Names of parameters:
```toml
[torii]
query_store_capacity = 128
query_store_capacity_per_user = 128
```

Also:
* Changed default value of query idle time from 30s to 10s (for the same reason to decrease potential peak memory usage)
* Changed default value of fetch size from 10 to 100 (I think it is strange that when query output has e.g. 1000 items, client currently has to send 100 requests to get full query result)

Some notes about implementation:
* Currently when adding new query, the message is send to `mpsc::channel`, and `LiveQueryStore` thread does the addition. I changed it to perform addition directly without `mpsc::channel` since we now need to check capacity and return error to client if it exceeds.

### Linked issue

Closes #4830

### Benefits

Add limit to number of live queries to prevent high memory usage in cases when client don't fully consume query output.

- block hash is the same for the whole lifetime of the block
- block hash is less expensive as only header is used
- light client is able to verify block chain by only headers and corresponding signatures (without obligation to load the whole block)

                ## Description

* make `Role` transparent in schema
* rename `NewXXX` to `XXX` when serializing as json

This is how schema looked like:
```json
"NewRole": {
  "Struct": [
    {
      "name": "inner",
      "type": "Role"
    }
  ]
},
```

but in genesis it was:
```json
{
  "Register": {
    "Role": {
      "id": "ALICE_METADATA_ACCESS",
      "permissions": [
        {
          "name": "CanRemoveKeyValueInAccount",
          "payload": {
            "account": "ed0120CE7FA46C9DCE7EA4B125E2E36BDB63EA33073E7590AC92816AE1E861B7048B03@wonderland"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "CanSetKeyValueInAccount",
          "payload": {
            "account": "ed0120CE7FA46C9DCE7EA4B125E2E36BDB63EA33073E7590AC92816AE1E861B7048B03@wonderland"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
},
```

which is the consequence of the fact that we have no way of representing transparency in schema

- committed topology is removed from block
- committed topology for latest and previous blocks are stored in the state
    - it's required for blocks sync
    - and for initializing state from the snapshot + block store
- initial topology in the genesis block is passed as transaction with `Register<Peer>` instructions
- trusted peers are removed from `World` constructor

Closes #4879 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

Less space used in the block store, easier to derive block hash.

<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->

### How to test

Run, try to submit new blocks, try restart peers check that iroha operates as usual.

<blockquote>
<p>43.0.0 - 2024-07-20</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1e has been
  removed.  Users on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.8.
* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.3.1.
* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.65.0, from 1.63.0.
* :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.generate_private_key`
  now enforces a minimum RSA key size of 1024-bit. Note that 1024-bit is still
  considered insecure, users should generally use a key size of 2048-bits.
* :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.serialize_certificates`
  now emits ASN.1 that more closely follows the recommendations in :rfc:`2315`.
* Added new :doc:`/hazmat/decrepit/index` module which contains outdated and
  insecure cryptographic primitives.
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.CAST5`,
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.SEED`,
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.IDEA`, and
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.Blowfish`, which were
  deprecated in 37.0.0, have been added to this module. They will be removed
  from the ``cipher`` module in 45.0.0.
* Moved :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.TripleDES`
  and :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ARC4` into
  :doc:`/hazmat/decrepit/index` and deprecated them in the ``cipher`` module.
  They will be removed from the ``cipher`` module in 48.0.0.
* Added support for deterministic
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.ECDSA` (:rfc:`6979`)
* Added support for client certificate verification to the
  :mod:`X.509 path validation &lt;cryptography.x509.verification&gt;` APIs in the
  form of :class:`~cryptography.x509.verification.ClientVerifier`,
  :class:`~cryptography.x509.verification.VerifiedClient`, and
  ``PolicyBuilder``
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.verification.PolicyBuilder.build_client_verifier`.
* Added Certificate
  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.public_key_algorithm_oid`
  and Certificate Signing Request
  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.public_key_algorithm_oid`
  to determine the :class:`~cryptography.hazmat._oid.PublicKeyAlgorithmOID`
  Object Identifier of the public key found inside the certificate.
* Added :attr:`~cryptography.x509.InvalidityDate.invalidity_date_utc`, a
  timezone-aware alternative to the naïve ``datetime`` attribute
  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.InvalidityDate.invalidity_date`.
* Added support for parsing empty DN string in
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.from_rfc4514_string`.
* Added the following properties that return timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects:
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.produced_at_utc`,
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.revocation_time_utc`,
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.this_update_utc`,
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.next_update_utc`,
  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPSingleResponse.revocation_time_utc`,
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Next release</h2>
<h2>Mypy 1.11</h2>
<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.11 to the Python Package Index (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mypy/">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy
</code></pre>
<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href="http://mypy.readthedocs.io">Read the Docs</a>.</p>
<h4>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h4>
<p>Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/">PEP 695</a>).
This feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the <code>--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax</code> flag, or with <code>enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax</code> in the mypy configuration file.
We plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>
<pre lang="python"><code># Generic function
def f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...
<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>
<h1>Generic class</h1>
<p>class C[T]:
def <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:
self.x = x</p>
<p>c = C('a')
reveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>
<h1>Type alias</h1>
<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]
</code></pre></p>
<p>This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.</p>
<h4>Support for <code>functools.partial</code></h4>
<p>Mypy now type checks uses of <code>functools.partial</code>. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.</p>
<p>This example will now produce an error:</p>
<pre lang="python"><code>from functools import partial
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<h2>8.3.1</h2>
<h1>pytest 8.3.1 (2024-07-20)</h1>
<p>The 8.3.0 release failed to include the change notes and docs for the release. This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.</p>
<h2>8.3.0</h2>
<h1>pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)</h1>
<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231">#12231</a>: Added [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.</li>
<li>The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with [--tb]{.title-ref}, and can be [auto|long|short|line|native|no]{.title-ref}.</li>
<li>Note: Even if you have [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} set, you won't see them if [--tb=no]{.title-ref}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some history:</p>
<p>With pytest 8.0, [-rx]{.title-ref} or [-ra]{.title-ref} would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.</p>
<p>This change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281">#12281</a>: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.</p>
<p>Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.
Supported values are <code>int</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, (unescaped) <code>str</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, <code>bool</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} &amp; <code>None</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}.</p>
<p>See <code>marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>
<p>-- by <code>lovetheguitar</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567">#12567</a>: Added <code>--no-fold-skipped</code> command line option.</p>
<p>If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped
by reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same
way as other statuses.</p>
<p>-- by <code>pbrezina</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improvements in existing functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469">#12469</a>: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,
replacing the previously established but confusing and outdated
reference to <code>setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;std:doc&quot;}
-- by <code>webknjaz</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544">#12544</a>, <a href="https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545">#12545</a>: Python virtual environment detection was improved by
checking for a <code>pyvenv.cfg</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;file&quot;} file, ensuring reliable detection on
various platforms -- by <code>zachsnickers</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>

                ## Description

I've noticed multiple issues with kura which this PR is aimed to fix.

1. Quick sequential call of `replace_top_block` and `store_block` cause kura to omit overwriting soft-fork block
    - this happened because kura checked latest_written_block hash against latest_block_hash which is not correct because between kura loop iteration more than one block could be added
2. Call `store_block` before or just after `start` cause kura to incorrectly assume amount of already written blocks
