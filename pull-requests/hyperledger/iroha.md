### Description of the Change

Incorporate the indirect dependencies: `smallvec` and `smallstr` into main iroha code. 
Measured a performance uplift of 10% ± 1%, measured using `torii` benchmark. 

Added extra crate for data primitives not directly related to `iroha_data_model`, called `iroha_data_primitives`. 

### Issue

Closes #1790.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
More performance

### Possible Drawbacks
 More work for library developers. 
 
 ### Tests
 
 ```
 cd client
 cargo bench # cargo bench torii will result in no runs executed. 
 ```
