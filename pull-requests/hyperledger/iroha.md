### Description of the Change

Refactored metric storage. 
Added more metrics. 
Added instrumentation for easily tracking query and isi execution and timing, via `iroha_data_model_derive` proc_macro crate. 

### Issue

Resolves #1331 


### Benefits

More metrics

### Possible Drawbacks

tracking metrics can adversely affect performance. 

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

TODO

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Instrumentation can be added by changing the trait topology for Queries and ISI.

* uniform format for compile tests
* enable `data_model` derive tests
* fix `IntoSchema` derive and add tests

It's quite easily possible to forget to include ui tests due to misconfiguration. Sticking with this convention would lower the possibility for that. We could also watch for `There are no trybuild tests enabled yet.` line in the CI as this would indicate no ui tests are actually being run even though `trybuild` is configured

`Io` derive was useless. Instead, use explicit `encode`/`decode` to convert to/from `Vec<u8>`.
No code is moved around (only removed) so this shouldn't affect port of bugfixes to release candidate

Also replaces `generics` fn in schema derive with `Generics::split_for_imp`.

### Description of the Change

There is a chance to fail to allocate buffer for block deserialization if its size was corrupted.
At the time try_allocate was still experimental and I coudn't use it. Now it's stable, so this is a planned enchancement.

### Benefits

We no longer depend on some particular "max buffer size" constant.

### Possible Drawbacks
