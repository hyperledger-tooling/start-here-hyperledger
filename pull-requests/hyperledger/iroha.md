#1751
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Fixes double spend attack, and general bug with same transaction being committed more than once. For more detailed overview please read the issue.

Previously wsv was updated after kura when it received the message from sumeragi. The bug was in the fact that sumeragi assumed it committed the block and updated its state, therefore able to approve next blocks, but the message might arrive to Kura a lot later. This made possible for the `is_in_blockchain` checks for transactions to pass sometimes even as some of them were in previous block. And therefore leaders could create blocks with same txs and other peers might approve it.

### Description of the Change

View change handling fixes

- View change proofs made independent of particular transaction hashes
- Reduced message passing
- Collect view change votes instead of sending messages right away (improves network resilience)
- Fully use Actor framework in Sumeragi (schedule messages to self instead of task spawns)

Improves fault injection for tests with Sumeragi

- Brings testing code closer to production code
- Removes overcomplicated wrappers
- Allows Sumeragi use actor Context in test code

Batch transaction gossiping

Significantly reduces message passing

Also fixes transaction count metric calculation, which previously was providing results delayed by 1 block.

### Issue
#1715
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- Network is more resilient - will recover in cases of faulty peers or after high load (when the load normalizes)
- Network is more performant: about 2 TPS previously, now 100 TPS

For measuring TPS:
- Python script was used
- Timeouts in config were increased
- Logging level was set to `ERROR`
- 4 peers through docker compose were ran locally on a machine with 16 GB or RAM, i7 8th gen.

                ### Description of the Change
- Prohibit a whitespace from getting into a `Name` of domain, account, asset, metadata key, and permission token.
- Identify `Domain` by `Id` instead of `Name`

Now `Id::new`s return `Result<Self>`, while previous implementations are left as `Id::test`s for usability

### Issue
Close #1734

### Benefits
Type level guarantee of no whitespaces in `Name` 

### Possible Drawbacks
There might be a better error handling for `Name` validation
