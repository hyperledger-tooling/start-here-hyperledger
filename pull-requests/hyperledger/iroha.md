### Description of the Change

I've found that often times I need to traverse the type and produce conversions from source to FFI compliant type and vice versa.
There have been a lot of code duplication and convoluted logic which this PR aims to resolve
Added `catch_unwind` to prevent UB when panicking over FFI

### Description of the Change

- Add `Role`-related match arm in `UnregisterBox` execution;

    - correctly early exiting if role doesn't exist;
- Add `Role`-related queries to client;
- Add tests:
    - to check that role removed from account after unregistering;
    - to check `Role`-related queries.
