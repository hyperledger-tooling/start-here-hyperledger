                ## Description

Ursa is a rust cryptographic library that iroha has been using for a lot of time. It combines several cryptographic libraries from crates.io and provides a unified interface. Unfortunately, it is no longer maintained, so we have to migrate to other ecosystem crates.

This PR does this by importing the parts of ursa code that we have been using into `iroha_crypto`. It then proceeds to clean the code up a bit, removing unused functionality, updating dependencies and simplifying internal APIs.

In the end, as ursa was just a unifying layer, iroha_crypto ends up using almost the same underlying cryptographic function implementations (except for a switch from C-based `secp256k1` to pure-rust `k256` for easier use as a wasm library in JS SDK later #4046).

### Linked issue

Closes #3422

### Benefits

Not having an unmaintained dependency is obviously a plus, allowing us to benefit from updates to upstream libraries.

### Future work

#4046, #4045
