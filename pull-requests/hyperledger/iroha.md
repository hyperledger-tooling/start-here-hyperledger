### Description of the Change

So Iâ€™ve been debugging #2457, and the problem there is as follows:

When we start a peer for tests, we [create](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/a2b373d7fb21dc24f27cf83bf1c8cb9a6b187b98/core/test_network/src/lib.rs#L673) a [TempDir](https://docs.rs/tempfile/latest/tempfile/struct.TempDir.html) for kura storage. It is then [held](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/a2b373d7fb21dc24f27cf83bf1c8cb9a6b187b98/core/test_network/src/lib.rs#L502) until the peer is dropped to prevent its deletion. But kura thread receiving new blocks actually [lives on its own](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/a2b373d7fb21dc24f27cf83bf1c8cb9a6b187b98/core/src/kura.rs#L77) and periodically [checks](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/a2b373d7fb21dc24f27cf83bf1c8cb9a6b187b98/core/src/kura.rs#L182) if all other references to kura have been dropped and then returns. 

What happens is essentially a race condition, where after a test is finished, peer is dropped, dropping the tempdir, but kura is in process of writing a new block, so it's working directory is pulled from underneath it. This causes kura thread to panic, which wasn't a problem on its own, but is now caught by panic handler and leads to failure.

This PR is my shot of solving it by providing an ability to forcibly shut kura down and doing just that while dropping a test peer.

### Issue

#2457

### Benefits

Kura doesn't panic in tests.

### Possible Drawbacks

Not a particularly elegant solution.

### Alternate Designs

We can't hold tempdir for long enough, since there's no scope that's guaranteed to exceed kura threads lifetime.

We also can't provide a method to just _wait_ for kura to shut down without forcing it to with how it's currently implemented, since kura shuts down only when all strong references to it are dropped, and there is one in the same task that holds the tempdir.

### Description of the Change

Add support for converting data-carrying enums to and from FFI types. FFI equivalents for enums are not opaque, rather they are structs generated with FFI representation. Take the following enum as an example:

```rs
#[derive(IntoFfi, TryFromReprC)]
pub enum Enumeration {
    A(u32),
    B(PublicKey),
    C,
}
```

for `IntoFfi` will generate:

```rs
impl IntoFfi for Enumeration {
    type Target = __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiTarget;
    
    fn into_ffi(self) -> Self::Target {
        ///
    }
}

unsafe impl ReprC for __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiTarget {}

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiTarget {
    tag: u8,
    payload: __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiTargetPayload,
}

#[repr(C)]
union __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiTargetPayload {
    A: <u32 as IntoFfi>::Target,
    B: <PublicKey as IntoFfi>::Target,
}
```

for `TryFromReprC` will generate:

```rs
impl<'itm> TryFromReprC<'itm> for Enumeration {
    type Source = __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationTryFromReprCSource<'itm>;
    type Store = (<u32 as TryFromReprC<'itm>>::Source, <PublicKey as TryFromReprC<'itm>>::Source);

    unsafe fn try_from_repr_c(source: Self::Source, store: &'itm mut Self::Store) -> Result<Self> {
        ///
    }
}

unsafe impl ReprC for __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationIntoFfiSource {}

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationTryFromReprCSource<'itm> {
    tag: u8,
    payload: __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationTryFromReprCSourcePayload<'itm>,
}

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
union __iroha_ffi__ReprCEnumerationTryFromReprCSourcePayload<'itm> {
    A: <u32 as TryFromReprC<'itm>>::Source,
    B: <PublicKey as TryFromReprC<'itm>>::Source,
}
```

### Issue

Closes #2622

### Benefits

Data-carrying enums can be used in FFI functions

<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
