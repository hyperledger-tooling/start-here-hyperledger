                ## Description

It fixes compiling `iroha_client_cli` as a separate package.

@timofeevmd noticed that `cargo build` works but `cargo run -p iroha_client_cli` doesn't in the DEV branch.

Some thoughts:
1) I suppose it happened because of the wrong public/private field mods we use when defining query struct fields. 
2) It was merged somehow and avoided CI checks.

### Linked issue

Close #3448 

### Benefits

developers and other contributors will be able to build `iroha_client_cli` separately.

`syn::visit::Visit` inspired visitor for validator. 
By the principle of least surprise the default implementation of `Validate` trait passes for every entity.
Users can copy the code in `default_validator` and adjust it to their own needs if the require some sensible defaults

### Linked issue

Closes  #3435

* It's easy for the writer of validator to plug in their own validation
