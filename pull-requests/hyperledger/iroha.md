### Description of the Change
1. Remove building and pushing of the `iroha2-base` image.
2. Introduce one-in-one `Dockerfile` with build layers.

### Issue
In some compilation cases as iroha building on M1, having Arch Linux base image is redundancy.

### Benefits
The current changes allow to keep the cache of rustup and cargo tools for the future branch workflows launches automatically.

### Possible Drawbacks
1. Cache is available only for the target workflow branch.
2. Only ex `base-image` is cached.
3. No any `cargo` dependencies will be cached within a particular conditions. 
4. We can't control and manage what is really caches using the `type=gha` cache mode.
5. The maximum cache size is up to 10 Gb (Github Actions limitation). [A possible way to bypass this limitation](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-layer-caching-in-github-actions)

### Note
The listed drawbacks would be resolved within the current PR or later.

### Description of the Change
1. Add `parent_commit` option to Codecov Upload Action with the branch SHA:

```
The commit SHA of the parent for which you are uploading coverage.
```
2. Disable codecov report upload as artifact Actions.

### Issue
Codecov Action bot doesn't show the correct diff between the head and PR branches.

### Benefits
`parent_commit` option could help to currently determine the right head branch merge commit.

### Possible Drawbacks
None, but it still could be not work.
