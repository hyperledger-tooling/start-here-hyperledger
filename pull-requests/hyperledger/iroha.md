### Description of the Change

I updated the outdated docs with actual information that describes what is contained inside of `Signature` structure. Also, I renamed an argument of `Signature::verify` method from `message` to `payload` to keep consistency with `Signature::new` method.

Ursa version bump from 0.3.5 to 0.3.6
### Benefits
1. Compatibility with latest wasmtime.
2. In general we should update crates to most recent versions.
3. 0.3.5 seems to have problems with a recently deprecated crate `aesni`
