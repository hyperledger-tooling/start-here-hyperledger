### Description of the Change

Refactored logging messages to adhere to structured logging format

* Use structured logging
* Use explicit `field` names

### Issue

Closes #1529 

### Benefits

Structured logging makes log messages more consistent and easier to parse.
Using explicit `field` names prevents accidental changes in log format if local variable names are modified. If clients depend on log parsing this will make log API more robust

### Description of the Change

* add commit-msg hook which ensures signoff is included

### Issue

Sometimes dev might forget to include signoff in the commit, this hook will automatically add signoff if missing

### Benefits

Developer has the option to automatically sign-off their commits. 


### Possible Drawbacks

The developer must understand what `sign-off` means in order to use the feature. And can unwittingly, commit code that they cannot. 

### Usage Examples or Tests 

```
$ cp hooks/commit-msg.sample .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Encouraging the developer to create an alias for commit. Also encouraging the developer to create GPG-signed commits.

### Description of the Change

as it's stated [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot)
```
Dependabot Preview has been shut down as of August 3rd, 2021. In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot.
```
Since I noticed dependabot was outdated I've upgraded it to version 2 which is now GitHub native. There were minor tweaks in the dependabot config API
