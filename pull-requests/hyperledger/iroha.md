### Description of the Change
- Separates gossiping from round in Sumeragi (therefore fixing MST edge case) see #1433
- Fixes a `panic` in queue on `unreachble()!` macro. It seems it is quite reachable :) Under high load and due to parallelism it can be invoked. We might improve the design here later. But for now it can be just replaced with `continue`
- Adds a docker-compose-local.yml setup to build and start containers locally for testing.
### Queue Bug
#### Setup
Local machine, docker compose with local images on latest dev commit
#### Steps
Submit txs with high frequency manually through iroha_client_cli
#### Result
Several peers stop doing anything, invalid state is reported by tokio due to `unreachable` macro in queue

After fix I tested locally with the same setup to verify that it is working. Later we can try to come up with appropriate test. See next steps.
### Next Steps
This bug fixup is urgent so some of the things that might have been included in this PR were moved to separate issues:
- #1480
- #1479

### Description of the Change

Initially, the task was to migrate to HL Ursa portable, to sever dependency on C libraries. 
Unfortunately, it turned out to be not the time yet, so I simply upgraded ursa version to 0.3.7 and removed all direct dependencies on ursa except for one in iroha_crypto.

### Benefits

iroha_crypto now encapsulates functionality provided by ursa (re-exports it actually) and we have a single point to set ursa version.

### Possible Drawbacks 

We should get back to the question of Rust-only solution later, possibly when Ursa will support it better.
