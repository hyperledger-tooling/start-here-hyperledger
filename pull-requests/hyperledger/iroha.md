### Description of the Change

A tiny correction for the error messages, which seem to be copied previously; the error message ''Failed to get all **accounts**" was used for:

```rust
.request(client::domain::all())
```

and 

```rust
.request(client::asset::all())
```

### Issue

I can open one if needed, but this is nothing more than a typo.

### Benefits

Error messages being displayed will be corrected.

### Possible Drawbacks

None

The minimum change to [remove `Identifiable` implementation from events](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2476#issuecomment-1184107169)

### Issue

- Relates to #2476

- Rationality that an event should not be identified by its origin

### Description of the Change
In Iroha 1.4 SyncingNode option was added. So I've updated documentation:
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15332594/179312734-8031a766-90b3-433d-aff4-4e7865dd7d58.png)
The update is using `commands.rst` instead of copy-paste.

I've also changed indentations in `queries.rst` - once it was 2 spaces, other time 4 spaces - I've unified into 4 spaces everywhere.

### Description of the Change

Buildscript for `client` relies on parsing `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` to check whether we are using nightly, which fails for non-rustup rust installations. This changes it to parse output of `rustc --version`.

### Issue

#2473 

### Benefits

More build environments supported.

### Possible Drawbacks

None

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->
* Automatic derivation of `Ord` / `Eq` / `Hash` for `Identifiable` entities.
* Derivation of `Identifiable` in a separate macro as well.
* More readable and modular code for `Filter` derive with custom structures (as mentioned in #2437).

Closes #1988, #2437.
<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
* Always compliant implementation of `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, `PartialEq` and `Hash`.
* Reduced repetitive code with `impl Identifiable` previously scattered throughout `data_model`.
* More readable `Filter` derive as compared to #2431.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
The `Identifiable` derivation might be a bit frail: so far it relies on there being exactly three possible types of entities that can derive it: `Event` enums, `IdBox` or almost any other `Identifiable` struct in `data_model`, with only the first option involving somewhat complex processing. If any type has a different impl for whatever reason than the rest of the structs, such as `NewRole`, which calls its `inner` field as well, the derive can't work and the trait has to be implemented manually.

### Description of the Change
Few days ago I had problem with enabling TLS connection (there are my questions in chat) - it took long time for me to understand how to set up the connection. That's why I decided to add some useful information which can save time for people like me, but in community chat some people told me that it is a good idea to update the documentation,

When I was changing documentation I noticed that there ale lots of small things to correct, so I corrected them.
Here is a list of changes:
1. In file `CONTRIBUTING.rst` there were invalid external links (sphinx requires format \`\`_ instead of \`\`).
2. In the file added link to discord official channel
3. Removed `make permissions` from `README.md` - the command is not working, everything is working without the command
4. Added notes about setting up TLS connection.
5. Added link to iroha-wallet-js (close to link for Borsello)
6. Link to python-examples in documentation where are python examples:D
7. Information about `iroha-burrow` official image in HL Burrow Integration section.
8. Corrected indentation in python code - python needs to be indented

### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->
Added configuration to enable Iroha shutting down on panic. This prevents the tests expecting panic to fail. Also, the test for the responsible panic hook is now sequential, to prevent side effects on parallel run, while the hook is enabled.

### Issue

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->
We [introduced](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2445) a panic hook, which shuts down Iroha on panic (which just shutting down the thread by default). But the hook affects other tests and make them flaky.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
Prevents tests flakiness. Allows users to choose the behavior on panic.

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
The biggest one is the difference between the test and the production environment. Also, as the test case for the hook is running sequentially, the overall tests performance has a very little degradation.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
It may seem that `#[cfg(not(test))]` can be used here, but it looks like integration tests ignore it.

Updating tests to work with the hook would be the best solution, but it's very hard to find out which tests should be updated, because random tests are failed and it's not clear which tests caused that.

Switching to [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) can also fix the issue.
