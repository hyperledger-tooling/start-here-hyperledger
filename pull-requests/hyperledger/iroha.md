### Description of the Change
This PR introduces `current_block_hash` field to `BlockHeaderValue`. This field contains the hash of the latest `VersionComittedBlock`. 
### Issue
When we query for block headers we cannot reliably compute the hash of the block, since it's computed from the byte representation of the block and can be architecture dependent.
### Benefits
The Hash of a block will no longer be architecture dependent. 
### Possible Drawbacks
Not that I know of.

### Description of the Change

While working on #2199 me and @appetrosyan have decided to split this work on several PRs, so that it will be easier to review.

We can't properly deserialize generics so we decided to make them be enum instead (at least there aren't much of things that needs permissions). It looks not so pretty, but it *much* easier to use with deserialization.

`permissions.rs` file now is very big, so I believe we should split it later. I don't do it now so that it will be easier to review (I hope)

Another important thing -- `World`s... The idea of mocking `World` with `WorldTrait` is quite painfull... I have created a new `MockWorld` but it's not used anywere yet. I'm not sure if we really need it.
Removing `W: WorldTrait` generic in some places and leaving it in another places causes me to use very wierd `W == World` runtime checks in 3 places. But it works fine for now.
The whole mocking architecture should be refactored here -- @appetrosyan  has some ideas.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Next steps

After merging this PR I'm gonna work on actual validators deserialization. It's probably gonna be another config named `permissions.json`. It will be implemented with another enum containing all possible validators from `permission_validators` folder.

### Issue

* Refers to #2199

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

* Easier to deserialize validators in the future

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

* More code doing pretty the same as before
* Wierd `W == World` checks in 3 places

- [x] Add sensible `fmt::Display` implementations to various structs. 
- [x] Add enum to process strings by `contains`, `is` and `starts/ends_with`
- [x] Add enum to target `Identifiables`, 
- [x] Add enum for Display
- [x] Add enum variant to target metadata values
- [x] Add predicate enum
- [x] Add combinator enum (optional) (and/or/not)

This PR makes `Revoke` role emit `RoleRevoked` instead of `Permission` event. 
### Issue
`Revoke` role emits `Permission` events which is a misleading since roles are a collection of permission events.
### Benefits
More accurate information about the user.
### Possible Drawbacks
Not sure about drawbacks because I am new to the codebase.

Replaced the declarative macro generating `endpointN` functions with a procedural one in a separate crate.

Resolves #2132.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Improved readability and extensibility.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
As the macro expansion uses `WarpResult` wrapper defined in `cli/src/torii/utils.rs`, all the users of macro should reexport that struct as well. Alternatively, the macro implementation could be amended to ditch the use of that altogether.

### Description of the Change

By the architecture of CLI seems the root task that other tasks depend on is spawning Torii's server so I just added a graceful shutdown for the Torii's server. Also I use [Notify](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Notify.html) primitive to notify that the application has received an OS signal because [oneshot channel](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/oneshot/index.html) doesn't support multiple receivers.

### Issue

Resolves #1926

### Benefits

Correct completion of all tasks before closing

### Possible Drawbacks

None
