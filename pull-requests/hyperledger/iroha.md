### Description of the Change

Currently client is built on top of blocking synchronous HTTP client, which is not very flexible for different use cases.

To make it more flexible, I've split some of the APIs into 2 parts:

1. Preparing transaction/query/other HTTP request in terms of pure data
2. Handle related HTTP response for this request

I've **moved the part of actual doing** the request out of this. By the way, current main function are still using the default http implementation, but these parts are moved out from it.

It is done with a new trait - `RequestBuilder`. I've added several functions to the `Client`:

- `prepare_query_request(query, pagination)`, that returns a tuple with a provided `RequestBuilder` and a special response handler.
- `prepare_transaction_request(tx)`, same as for queries, but also returns a hash of a transaction.
- `prepare_status_request()`, same as above, but simpler.

There are also 3 new structs - `QueryResponseHandler`, `TransactionResponseHandler` and `StatusResponseHandler`. All of them encapsulates the logic of handling an HTTP-response in a correct way.

I haven't touched WebSocket-based logic and some other complex utilities that rely on default HTTP client yet. Anyway it should be refactored as well.

Also I've refactored the http internal module itself.

### Issue

Resolves #2144 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

- Possibility to use `iroha_client` with custom HTTP transport, even async. **Only for queries, transactions and status for now.**
- Usage of `trait RequestBuilder` allows to build requests in an efficient way. It would be less efficient if build it via callbacks or by returning the exact request structure.
- Client is still responsible to handle http response
- You don't need to import anything to handle response, and currently "responders" are a zero-cost abstraction
- Existing client API hasn't been changed, but has been extended.

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

- `Headers` are still `HashMap<String, String>`, which can be optimized in scope of `RequestBuilder` trate.
- Response handlers expect `Response` structure from the `http` crate. It may be unefficient if custom http implementation returns some other response and user has to transform it first. Maybe it is better to replace `Response` with some trait.

### Usage Examples or Tests

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

Existing client methods now uses the same API, but with default HTTP client. See how they now work.

<!-- ### Alternate Designs -->

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

The idea is the same as in #2147, but now it is about WebSocket side.

Iroha Events API and Blocks Stream API are built on top of the same WebSocket flow:

1. Open a WS connection
2. Client sends some "subscription" message
3. Server responses with some "accepted" message
4. Client waiting for some events and responses to them with some "accepted" message, not same as for p.3

In this PR I've normalized this flow with a few traits. They are binded to each. Their relationship aims to provide API that targets these goals:

- don't have `dyn`s, but clear abstraction
- prevent "invariant violation" by scoping flow stages in separate traits
- be functional and data-oriented

Also, I've refactored `trait RequestBuilder`. Now it forces to call `.body()` fn anyway to get the output of the builder. It is how `RequestBuilder` from `http` crate works. With this design, its impls became clearer.

### Issue

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

Resolves #2145 

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

With this change, it is possible to use Events API with any WebSocket client, async or not.

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

I don't like naming of `WebSocketFlowXXX` traits.

### Usage Examples or Tests

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

See how now Events API is implemented. Note that all data-related logic is incapsulated within flow-structs, and all transportation logic is moved away from it.

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
