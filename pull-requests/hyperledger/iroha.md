### Description of the Change

Added possibility to use [Basic Auth](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-basic-authentication) for `client`

### Issue

Closes #1918

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Simple use-case is to access Iroha, that is deployed on AWS servers, which requires Basic Auth

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

See `iroha_client::client::tests::basic_auth` module

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Suggestion

May be we can use something like `iroha_doc` to generate docs for client's `config.json`.
