Hook into `visit_unregister_*` was added to remove associated permission tokens.

I've decided not to add this cleanup logic for the `Asset` entity because asset entity could be added and remove multiple times (for example when asset value reach 0).

Also i've made decision not to use macros here as imo it wouldn't bring much value here.

### Benefits

Tokens are cleaned up.

### Drawbacks

Uninteresting entities could became potentially expensive as we have to iterate through every token.

Fixed CI lints

`missing_panics_doc` now fires for every public function that calls `Option::expect` or `Result::expect`. In some cases (like `Metadata`) I've extracted the panicking into a special private function because I don't think it's a good solution to just slap `missing_panics_doc` on every function that asserts invariants. We definitely want to get rid of these warnings, but what to do about it?
