                ## Description

After a discussion with the team, we decided that it is better to not have Kagami documentation in README than having an outdated one. Since it is a CLI tool with no stable API, having reliable help message (thanks to `clap`) is enough.

See https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/3509#issuecomment-1581766055

### Linked issue

_No issue_

### Benefits

Lower chance to have outdated documentation in the README. Therefore, lower chance to confuse future users.

#3475 introduces `kagami swarm` command, but it works only in directory mode. Now it is possible to produce both a "battery-included" directory and just a single file. The latter usage is especially helpful to generate sample docker-compose configurations to store them in the repo (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.single.yml` etc):

```bash
# only `docker-compose.yml`
kagami swarm file ./docker-compose.yml --build . --config-dir ./configs/peer --p 4 --seed "Kagami"

# a whole directory `test-swarm`
kagami swarm dir ./test-swarm --build . -p 4 --seed "Kagami"
```

### Linked issue

Closes #2373

### Benefits

We can automatise Docker Compose configurations generation and avoid problems with having outdated files in the repo. It will help the community.

### Checklist

- [x] Remove `--outfile` and `--outdir` options, use positionals instead
- [ ] Create an issue to include compose files generation into CI
- [x] Self-review

3. Add `docker.soramitsu.co.jp/iroha2/iroha2:dev-${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` iroha2 image tag to push to Soramitsu registry for PR-generator.

### Linked issue
1. We don't have `Coveralls` coverage tool badge.
2. PR-generator deployment hasn't bee finished.
3. #3562 

### Benefits
1. `Coveralls` badge.
2. PR-generator should work after merging the corresponding PR with Jenkins library (I'LL NOTIFY WHEN IT WILL BE ABLE TO BE TESTED)!
3. Fix JDK 11 Set up in the `Release-PR` workflow.

### Checklist

- [X] Done the work
