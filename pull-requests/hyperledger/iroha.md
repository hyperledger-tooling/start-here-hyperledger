### Description of the Change

- Added back the self-hosted CI runners. 
- Made all `cargo` commands quiet to improve readability (this reduces the verbosity of test outputs, but still produces the full logs and messages for the failing tests). 

### Issue

Closes #1630 



### Benefits

Better readability

### Possible Drawbacks
Self-hosted runners can break.

### Description of the Change
According to [documentation](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/configure/index.html) the param `max_rounds_delay` is deprecated and replaced with `proposal_creation_timeout` so I've made those changes in `example/config.*` files. I've also replaced deprecated DB connection string in  `example/config.docker` to be not deprecated.

### Issue
Changes will complete another issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1654
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Example config files in sync with documentation
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
If somebody would use old iroha (e.g. 1.1.3) it would not work, but the person should change tag in repository into: `1.1.3` and everything would be fine.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
Tested on local iroha storage:
```
$  Pulpit docker images
hyperledger/iroha-burrow   1.3.0        379586614dad   2 weeks ago     195MB
```
<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*
Alternatively it would be to add another config files with name e.g. `config.1.3.0.docker` instead of existing files modifications. IMO it would be worse solution because official docker images are using only files with name `config.docker`.
<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

            <td>
                ### Description of the Change

Added a [`prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) end-point to iroha2. 

### Issue

Closes #1216 

### Benefits

Prometheus Monitoring is possible. 
 
The following metrics are gathered:
- uptime since genesis. 
- currently connected peers
- block height
- total transactions

### Possible Drawbacks
Small overhead to block commit. 

### Usage Examples or Tests 

Install `prometheus`. 

Run an iroha peer (or network) using either 
`docker compose up`
or directly. 

run 
```bash
prometheus --config.file=configs/prometheus.yml
```
to scrape for the metric. 

Transactions per second should be handled by prometheus. 


### Alternate Designs 

Could compute a running average of TPS and send it to the status endpoint. 

This is error-prone and unnecessary, since the TPS can be computed while processing the `prometheus` data.

Wait for peers to commit genesis in tests.
Also adds a genesis submission delay, which is useful as peers can take some time to connect to each other.

### Description of the Change

Added notes that in configuration proposal delay must be bigger than proposal_creation_timeout.
Tried to add some information on ports for metrics (please review it carefully, I am not very sure about that).

Also fixed a couple of indentation warnings for doc build.

* Move `World` from `data_model` into `wsv` as it will never be used by clients. 
* Implement `IntoSchema` for blocks and transitive dependencies as a preparation for block streaming
* rename `Query` -> `ExecutableQuery`, `QueryOutput` -> `Query`
* fix `roles` feature inconsistencies
* move some transaction structures to `data_model`. Will be used for block streaming

### Description of the Change

1. Fixes a bug accidentally introduced by FuturesUnordered pr
2. Fixes usual failures of `unregister_peer` test, which did not wait for needed amount of time

### Bug Description

In `test_network` and `sumeragi_with_mock` tests in several places there were dependencies on particular order of the responses that `Network::send` (now `Network::send_to_actors_on_peers`) would return. With introduction of `FuturesUnordered` the order is now random there, so tests started failing from time to time.

The general problem was that code that used the function assumed a specific behavior of the function which was neither documented nor contained in a type.
