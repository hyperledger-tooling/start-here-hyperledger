### TODO

- [ ] Define all consts (like `docker-compose.yml`, `config` dir, `iroha-clone` dir, iroha repo etc)
- [ ] Don't serialize empty `command` field (now it is `command: null`)
- [ ] Get git revision in the same way as main Iroha CLI does (remove `git-version` dependency)
- [ ] Remove Dockerhub support?
- [ ] UI: implement prompting (using `unquiry`)
- [ ] UI: add logging throughout the process. Add spinner (using `spinoff`) during the long-running processes, like validator compilation
- [ ] Fix rest of Iroha according to updates in `ConfigurationProxy`
- [ ] #3473: Support standalone validator compilation
- [ ] Finish unit tests
