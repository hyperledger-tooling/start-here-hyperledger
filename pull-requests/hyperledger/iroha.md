                ## Description

As a workaround for the upstream issue in `serde` we must manually implement the code that would be generated by `serde(untagged)`. This also has the added benefit of preserving the error messages, but unfortunately comes at the cost of using `serde_json::Value`, and a `Clone::clone` call to the entire candidate value. 

Unfortunately, until the issue is fixed upstream, there is no better way to handle this. 

### Linked issue

Closes #3330 in `iroha2-dev`. Fix was already implemented in `iroha2-lts`. 

### Benefits

Fully-functional deserialization.

```

New error message:

```
Error: Transaction was rejected

Caused by:
   0: Validation failed
   1: Not permitted
   2: Validator denied the operation [TRANSFER `1` FROM `rose##alice@wonderland` TO `admin@admin`] by `admin@admin`
   3: Can't transfer assets of another account
```

<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->

### Further work

We should return a more detailed error from validator. I.e. it should explain on which instruction validation of transaction failed.
Also we should try to avoid using `Trap` because hard to work with when trying to analyze errors.

### Linked issue

### TODO

- [ ] Define all consts (like `docker-compose.yml`, `config` dir, `iroha-clone` dir, iroha repo etc)
- [ ] Don't serialize empty `command` field (now it is `command: null`)
- [ ] Get git revision in the same way as main Iroha CLI does (remove `git-version` dependency)
- [ ] Remove Dockerhub support?
- [ ] UI: implement prompting (using `unquiry`)
- [ ] UI: add logging throughout the process. Add spinner (using `spinoff`) during the long-running processes, like validator compilation
- [ ] Fix rest of Iroha according to updates in `ConfigurationProxy`
- [ ] #3473: Support standalone validator compilation
- [ ] Finish unit tests
