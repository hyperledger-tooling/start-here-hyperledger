### Description of the Change

The README.md file has a few broken links likely due to the default branch rename so I changed the links to contain `main` in it instead.

### Benefits

For example the build status from Jenkins should start showing green after this (right now it says it's failing because of some old build from March.

### Possible Drawbacks

None that I'm aware of.

### Description of the Change

I updated the outdated docs with actual information that describes what is contained inside of `Signature` structure. Also, I renamed an argument of `Signature::verify` method from `message` to `payload` to keep consistency with `Signature::new` method.

Ursa version bump from 0.3.5 to 0.3.6
