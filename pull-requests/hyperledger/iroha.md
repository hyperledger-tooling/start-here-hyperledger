### Description of the Change

ReadTheDocs started to fail documentation builds due to time out. Doxygen is taking ~20 min of build. 
The quick fix would be to remove Doxygen for now so the documentation could be built - later, if there is a need for Doxygen (that seems not too popular too) we could submit an issue to RTD and ask for help with resources or in other ways they could help. It is also possible to just return to the way we used to host doxygen - in a separate place.

### Benefits

Built docs

### Possible Drawbacks

Someone might need doxygen
