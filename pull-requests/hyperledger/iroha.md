                ### Description of the Change

Refactored the pr-workflows to be more parallelisable and granular. This should help in case a heavy workload needs to be re-run (e.g. it exited with `SIGKILL`). This should also reduce waiting times for longer workloads as more workflows can be run concurrently.

### Issue

#1526 

### Benefits

Shorter CI turnaround. Ability to re-run only the heavy workflows. 

### Possible Drawbacks

None at the moment

### Usage Examples 

Suppose PR #XXXX is blocked by a failing `print-telemetry` job, which exited with SIGKILL. This is likely because of using too much memory and being killed by the server, so instead of pushing, it's better to just re-run the heavy workflow, rather than re-run all the workflows. 

### THIS IS A DRAFT PR. Please do not merge, just comment.

### Description of the Change
Introduce sending telemetry to substrate-telemetry. There are two messages: the initialization message that indicates the node configuration and the update message that indicates the peers, transactions, blocks.
The telemetry can be configured with the following parameters:
```
"TELEMETRY": {
    "NAME": "Your node's name",
    "URL": "ws://localhost:8001/submit"
}
```
