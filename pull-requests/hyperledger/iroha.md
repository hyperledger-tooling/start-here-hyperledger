### Description of the Change

Removal of arguments from test_network crate

### Issue

It is a failure point for us to have arguments in tests, as they force us to read from disk. Also that forces us to take with us 3 configs and put them everywhere in tests.

### Benefits

Less errors due to disk failures. Easier genesis usage in tests.

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->
