To make the change manageable, this PR only introduces the `client` flag. The flag does not expand to completely valid code yet. This is expected to be completed with #2231

### Description of the Change

Remove explicit `drop` call through the codebase. 
There were 2 use cases for `drop`:
- Ignore `Result` and pass `clippy` linting: replaced with `let _result = some_func_call(...)`. IMO ideally we should handle errors not ignoring them;
- Actually free some resource: replaced with proper scope.

### Description of the Change

* Removed as much output-like supertraits from validators as possible
* `Debug` was replaced with `Display`
* `Display` implemented for permissions validators
* `Display` was also implemented for instructions, queries and expressions

This gives us much more readable error output when something is wrong with permissions. See examples below.

* Impls #2334. Why it was already closed I have no idea

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

* Better permission error messages
* More things can be `Display`ed now
* No more `Debug` supertrait for validators

### Description of the Change

Make PermissionToken Ids Registrable (world-scoped by analogy to roles) and require registering PT id before granting it.
Also add query to find all registered PermissionToken ids.

### Issue

#2052 

### Benefits

More consistent API, ability to query for all permission tokens.

### Possible Drawbacks

A bit more cumbersome to work with.

### Alternate Designs

As described in #2052, disallow creating PermissionTokens dynamically and parametrize iroha with strongly-typed list of available permission tokens.

### Description of the Change

Replaces the lexicographical order of assets with a timestamp-based order in `AssetsMap`.

For example:

Before: `1 (1658432537)`, `10 (1658432546)`, `2 (1658432538)`, `3 (1658432539)`, `4 (1658432540)`, `5 (1658432541)`, `6 (1658432542)`, `7 (1658432543)`, `8 (1658432544)`, `9 (1658432545)`.

Now: `1 (1658432537)`, `2 (1658432538)`, `3 (1658432539)`, `4 (1658432540)`, `5 (1658432541)`, `6 (1658432542)`, `7 (1658432543)`, `8 (1658432544)`, `9 (1658432545)`, `10 (1658432546)`.

Where `N` is Id and `T` is an insertion timestamp in `N (T)` format.

### Issue

Resolves #2501 

### Benefits

Order now depends on insertion timestamp.

### Possible Drawbacks

The queries that retrieve an asset will execute a bit slower because `O(log n)` (current implementation) and `O (log n + log n)` (twice b-tree lookup) (impl in this PR).
