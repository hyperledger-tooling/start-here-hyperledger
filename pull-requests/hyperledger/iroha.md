                ## Description

I was poking around the codebase and refactored a few things:
* with `ProofBuilder` we're assured that proof always has at least one signatures
* with `BlockBuilder` only block that is chained and signed is called a block. Intermediate stages are encapsulated with the builder
* with `Candidate<B>` there is less code duplication
