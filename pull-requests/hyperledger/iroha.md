                ## Description

Stop-gap solution to make recovering original WASM blobs easier for WorldStateView API consumers such as iroha-squash.

### Linked issue

Partially addresses #3516

### Benefits

As per description, squashing blockchain is nigh impossible otherwise, since we need to report which smartcontracts to put where.

                ## Description
Switch from `Codecov` to `Coveralls` coverage tool for iroha2-dev workflow.

### Linked issue
`Codecov` coverage tool doesn't show the correct percentage of code coverage between base and head branches during the  PR CI workflow job. This always shows a decrease in the code coverage value by some percentage.

### Benefits
Hopefully [`Coveralls` coverage tool](https://coveralls.io/repos) with help to solve the issue above.
