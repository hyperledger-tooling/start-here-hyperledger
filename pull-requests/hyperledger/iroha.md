<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

There was a problem during TPS testing where block sync could not occur quickly because it would re-request the
same blocks from each peer. Here is a solution that should be robust against that scenario but doesn't introduce
any new issues.

                ## Description

Consider `client.toml`:
```toml
torii_url = "http://iroha-test.com/peer-1/"
```
Currently `/peer-1/` part will be ignored and queries will be send to `http://iroha-test.com/query`. This PR fixes it

### Benefits

Fix using `torii_url` with path in `client.toml`

## Description

We had some unnecessary dependencies on `iroha_wasm_builder`, blocking the build of iroha cli and client. This PR removes those and makes it so only the `iroha_wasm_builder` cli and integration tests actually depend on the crate.

As a part of this change, `construct_executor` utility function is moved from `iroha_cli` to `test_network`, as it only gets used in tests. Not _entirely_ happy with its new location, but `iroha_cli` is definitely a worse place for this.

### Linked issue

Closes #4882

### Benefits

Hopefully, faster incremental builds in cases when integration tests are not being built.

                ## Description

Added two new config parameters which limits number of live queries (global and per-user). Default value for both is 128. This is needed to prevent high memory usage in cases when client sends a lot of queries with large output, but do not fully consume those queries (that is obtain only first batch and doesn't send requests for the next batches). Normally clients should not do this, but malicious third-party can send such requests to DDOS iroha peer. In case limits are exceeded, iroha peer will return error "429 too many requests" for the query request.

* Names of parameters:
```toml
[torii]
query_store_capacity = 128
query_store_capacity_per_user = 128
```

Also:
* Changed default value of query idle time from 30s to 10s (for the same reason to decrease potential peak memory usage)
* Changed default value of fetch size from 10 to 100 (I think it is strange that when query output has e.g. 1000 items, client currently has to send 100 requests to get full query result)

Some notes about implementation:
* Currently when adding new query, the message is send to `mpsc::channel`, and `LiveQueryStore` thread does the addition. I changed it to perform addition directly without `mpsc::channel` since we now need to check capacity and return error to client if it exceeds.

### Linked issue

Closes #4830

### Benefits

Add limit to number of live queries to prevent high memory usage in cases when client don't fully consume query output.

                ## Description

Derive block hash from the header only.

<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

### Linked issue

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

Closes #4641 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

- block hash is the same for the whole lifetime of the block
- block hash is less expensive as only header is used
- light client is able to verify block chain by only headers and corresponding signatures (without obligation to load the whole block)
