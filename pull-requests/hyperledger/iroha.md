1. The bot was observed to remove a label manually added to PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4309#issuecomment-1958760549
2. At the same time, the bot was observed to notify false-positive `config-changes` due to its wrong definition

### Benefits

1. Always prioritize manual labeling/unlabeling
2. Necessary and sufficient `config-changes` notifications

<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->
