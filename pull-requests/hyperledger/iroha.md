### Description of the Change

Initially I was planning to implement 3'rd test-case from #1890, but I forgot, that me and @appetrosyan decided to implement it with roles, not with triggers. But in the moment of realizing I've already finished this task, so here I am

- Some functions refactored to be const
- Added possibility to create pre-commit triggers as another kind of time-triggers
- Added integration test for pre-commit trigger
