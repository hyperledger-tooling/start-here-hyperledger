                ## Description

Implemented manual deserialisation for `NumericValue` to circumvent https://github.com/serde-rs/json/issues/846. 

All `NumericValue` instances can now be deserialised from a string directly. 

All instances of `NumericValue::U128` are now preferentially serialised as tagged string-valued enums. Literal syntax deserialisation is supported but discouraged, given the slowness of processing. 

### Linked issue

Closes #3330 
Closes #3539 

### Benefits

More flexible syntax

### Drawbacks

Potentially slower deserialsation
