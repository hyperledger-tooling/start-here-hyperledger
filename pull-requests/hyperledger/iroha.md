### Description of the Change

Refactored logging messages to adhere to structured logging format

* Use structured logging
* Use explicit `field` names

### Issue

Closes #1529 

### Benefits

Structured logging makes log messages more consistent and easier to parse.
Using explicit `field` names prevents accidental changes in log format if local variable names are modified. If clients depend on log parsing this will make log API more robust

### Description of the Change

* add commit-msg hook which ensures signoff is included

### Issue

Sometimes dev might forget to include signoff in the commit, this hook will automatically add signoff if missing

### Benefits

Developer has the option to automatically sign-off their commits. 


### Possible Drawbacks

The developer must understand what `sign-off` means in order to use the feature. And can unwittingly, commit code that they cannot. 

### Usage Examples or Tests 

```
$ cp hooks/commit-msg.sample .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Encouraging the developer to create an alias for commit. Also encouraging the developer to create GPG-signed commits.
