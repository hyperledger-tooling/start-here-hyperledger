                ## Description

Previously 2 separate queues were used to send `insert`/ `remove` request to live query service which lead to issues when `insert`, `remove` were one right after another so that ordering of message processing was screwed.

Now single queue is used for messsages which guarantee that messages are processed sequentially eliminating possibility of this bug.

I noticed that with soft disk space free up on the default runner for `long` tests into `I2::Release::Tests` we still receive the error `[long](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/actions/runs/6850948216/job/18626197954)
System.IO.IOException: No space left on device`.
I propose to use the specific Action for hard disk space free up.

### Linked issue
[Failed long tests job](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/actions/runs/6850948216/job/18626197954)

### Benefits
Free up more disk space as much it's possible to be able to execute long release tests.
