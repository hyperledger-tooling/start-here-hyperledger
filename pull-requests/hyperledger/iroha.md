                ## Description
1. Update `iroha2ci-image` to the latest nightly toolchain (`2024-01-12`).
2. Bump `ci-contaier` in workflows to `hyperledger/iroha2-ci:nightly-2024-01-12`
3. Revert to the custom base branch comparison for Coveralls

### Linked issue
#4184 #4131 

### Benefits
1. Use the freshest rust nightly toolchain in CI
2. Attempt to normalize the Coveralls work

### IMPORTANT NOTE
Since we have updated the ci-image, WE MUST build and push it before the actual workflows will start to use it in CI. Previously we did it outside iroha repo (usually from forks) using the special HL DockerHub credentials that Hyperledger provided to us. Unfortunately, as Ry Jones told, they decided to remove these credentials since they can't continue to pay for that. Thus, we must to build and push the new ci-image asap when this PR will be merged.
