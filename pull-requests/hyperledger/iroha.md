<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change

Issue #1896 occured because `produce_event` function has misleading statement: 

```rust
return warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
```
So to avoid confusion it was decided to refactor `produce_event`.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Resolves #1896.

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

No confusion.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs

Firstly alternative `produce_event` implementation was considered, but clippy rejects it.

Clippy error: ```error: use Option::map_or_else instead of an if let/else```

Alternative implementation: 

```rust
/// Send [`Event`]s to known subscribers.
fn produce_event(&self, event: impl Into<Event>) {
    if let Some(events_sender) = &self.events_sender {
        drop(events_sender.send(event.into()));
    } else {
        warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
    }
}
```

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
