Hyphens (-) should be used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. I've searched for the use of hyphens in this repo and made corrections: sometimes changing hyphens to dashes (—), sometimes to other punctuation marks.

To avoid merge conflicts, I did not change the `client/src/http.rs` file (I've left a comment in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2864 about hyphens)
