                ### Description of the Change

Right now structs, enums and etc. are mentioned by simply putting them in ``.
I changed them to actual links instead, so that documentation will be easier to browse.

### Benefits

Documentation is easier to browse.

### Possible Drawbacks 

None.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
