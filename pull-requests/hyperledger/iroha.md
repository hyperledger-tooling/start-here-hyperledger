                ## Description

Stop-gap solution to make recovering original WASM blobs easier for WorldStateView API consumers such as iroha-squash.

### Linked issue

Partially addresses #3516

### Benefits

As per description, squashing blockchain is nigh impossible otherwise, since we need to report which smartcontracts to put where.

### Checklist

- [x] I've used the standard signed-off commit format (or will squash just before merging)
- [ ] All applicable CI checks pass (or I promised to make them pass later)

Switch from `Codecov` to `Coveralls` coverage tool for iroha2-dev workflow.

### Linked issue
`Codecov` coverage tool doesn't show the correct percentage of code coverage between base and head branches during the  PR CI workflow job. This always shows a decrease in the code coverage value by some percentage.

### Benefits
Hopefully [`Coveralls` coverage tool](https://coveralls.io/repos) with help to solve the issue above.

Rules:
* Never use structs named `*Box` in the client code or integration tests. These structs exist only for serialization
* Never refer to `V1` in any crate except `data_model` or in tests in other crates. Ideally, I would make them private

Changes:

- Add wsv related benchmarks;
- Remove interior-mutability from wsv;
- Optimize cloning of wsv for different actors;
- Add persistent structures for wsv;

<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

### Bemchmarks

```text
base:
    time:   [1.6779 s 1.6927 s 1.7093 s]
no interior mutability: 
    time:   [1.2139 s 1.2439 s 1.2818 s]
persitent structures:
    time:   [12.324 s 12.386 s 12.446 s]
```

### Benefits

- New benchmarks.
- No interior mutability in the WSV, no potential for deadlock.
- Clone is very cheep fir wsv and constant in time.

### Downsides

Isi execution became much slower (benchmark results) and cloning is taking not so much time comparing to the application of the block.

What's more is that cloning could be minimized:
1. Partially i did this in this PR for block_sync and gossiper actors, they clone wsv once per block.
2. If @mversic idea with wasm executor will be pulled of, we wouldn't need to clone wsv for verification.

Persistent data-structures is much slower compared to the std implementations (at least in `rpds` crate).

### Notes 

In current state i would like to merge everything except last commit where i introduced persistent data structures for wsv.
