                ### Description of the Change
1. Create a workflow to build and push `iroha2-ci:nightly-<>` image.
2. In `I2::Dev::Publish` substitute `on pull_request` trigger by `on workflow_run` trigger that allows to share Actions Secrets to push dev images before base branch merging.
3. Update some Actions versions.

### Issue
1. #2577  
2. #2606 

### Benefits
1. Covers #2577 issue.
2. Covers #2606 issue.

### Possible Drawbacks
We have to build and push `iroha2-ci:nightly-<>` image before to apply changes to `container: image` value.

### Description of the Change

See #3155 for bug details.

To fix it I used [thread-local-panic-hook](https://crates.io/crates/thread-local-panic-hook) crate. It's not popular at all, but it solves our problem.

So when `test-network` feature is enabled I set thread local panic hook instead of basic panic hook (process local).

Also I removed useless invocation of previously set hook.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

- #3155 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Panic in one test won't cause Iroha shutdowns in another tests.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Drawbacks

When `test-network` feature is activated all sub-threads (e.g. Sumeragi thread) won't have specified panic-hook. Instead they will have a default one.

I and @appetrosyan decided that this this acceptable because of this:

- Sumeragi and etc. are designed to not panic because of client actions
- It works normally right now
- There will be no new integration tests in future. They will be rewritten in Python
- After rewriting tests this change will be rollbacked

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

Don't know how to prove that it fixes the problem. But it works for me in #3106 .

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs

There is an idea how to fix this problem with sub-threads but it doesn't worth implementation

### Description of the Change
I noticed that in examples queries were not working - after some time of investigation I noticed that `counter` must be greated than 0, but default  value is 0. So I changed into 1. Also I added another example file with error checking (it was my first time with GRPC in C++ so there can be errors)

### Description of the Change
Enable `iroha2-dev` image uploading  to Soramitsu images registry.

### Issue
Some time ago we did the same thing for `stable&lts` tags: #3049. Now we have a need to upload the `dev` tag as well. 

### Benefits

We will have the opportunity to test the freshest iroha2 features like #3120 within k8s deployment and do not encounter pulling limitation on DockerHub.

### Possible Drawbacks
None.
