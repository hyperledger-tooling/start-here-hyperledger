<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->

<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change
* `LoadFromEnv` and `LoadFromDisk` updated to return proxy configs in any case, without failure
* `Combine` trait now properly loads inner config values, updating all the fields
* Documentation for all proxy traits in `config/base/lib.rs` updated
* Small refactor of `config/base/derive/src/view.rs`, mostly in connection with #2773 
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
None I could think of
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests
Some new tests added to `config/base/tests/simple.rs`, reworked `config/base/lib.rs` documentation examples as well
<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Description of the Change

Add a new subcommand to the Client CLI that accepts wasm binaries and executes them.

### Issue

Closes #2508

### Benefits

Allow executing wasm binaries from the Client CLI.

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Save it into a WAT file.
```wasm
(module
            
        ;; Import host function to execute instruction
        (import "iroha" "execute_instruction"
            (func $exec_isi (param i32 i32)))

        ;; Import host function to execute query
        (import "iroha" "execute_query"
            (func $exec_query (param i32 i32) (result i32)))

        ;; Embed ISI into WASM binary memory
        (memory (export "memory") 1)
        (data (i32.const 0) "\00\0d\09\00\04\30\00\00\06\00\0d\09\00\04\31\00\00\05\0d\02\00\08\2c\75\6e\72\65\61\63\68\61\62\6c\65\01\07\08\00\0d\09\00\04\32\00\00\00\0d\09\00\04\33\00\00")

        ;; Variable which tracks total allocated size
        (global $mem_size (mut i32) i32.const 53)

        ;; Export mock allocator to host. This allocator never frees!
        (func (export "_iroha_wasm_alloc") (param $size i32) (result i32)
            global.get $mem_size

            (global.set $mem_size
                (i32.add (global.get $mem_size) (local.get $size)))
        )
        

            ;; Function which starts the smartcontract execution
            (func (export "_iroha_wasm_main") (param)
                (call $exec_isi (i32.const 0) (i32.const 8))(call $exec_isi (i32.const 8) (i32.const 45))))
```

Pass the file like this
```sh
./iroha_client_cli wasm --path=./test.wat
```

Hyphens (-) should be used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. I've searched for the use of hyphens in this repo and made corrections: sometimes changing hyphens to dashes (—), sometimes to other punctuation marks.

To avoid merge conflicts, I did not change the `client/src/http.rs` file (I've left a comment in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2864 about hyphens)
