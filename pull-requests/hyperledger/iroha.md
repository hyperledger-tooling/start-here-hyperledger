### Description of the Change

In order to achieve niche value optimization least significant bit of hash set to be always 1.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Don't use all zero hash as null value, instead use `Option<Hash>` without loses in size. 

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

- Unsafe code
- Least significant bit of hash is always 1, which can cause compatibility issues with `blake2b` hashing algorithm. 
- Can't implement `Display` for `Option<Hash>`

### Description of the Change

All signatures received through `BlockSigned` are stored waiting for voting block.
After voting block received through `BlockCreated` accumulated signatures are verified against this block.  

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Closes #2999

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- Handle case when `BlockSigned` recieved before `BlockCreated` correctly.
- Do not repeat work of signature verification on every cycle.
