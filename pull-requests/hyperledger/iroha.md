### Benefits
Allow to build and publish `iroha2-nightly` image.

### Possible Drawbacks
None.

            <td>
                ### Description of the Change
1. Modify iroha2 CI in order to enable conditional step of `iroha2-base` image build if its `Dockerfile.base` has been changed.
2. Get back `I2::Dev::Label` workflow since we are able to apply the same approach as for `base-image` build.
3. Remove necessaries iroha2-dev-pr-label-config.yml` and `iroha2-dev-pr-label-api.yml` workflows files.

### Issue
Since `tj-actions/changed-files` and `dorny/paths-filter` Actions doesn't work within `hyperledger/iroha` repository, this is another one possible solution to resolve #2732.

### Benefits
1. Refactoring of iroha2 CI.
2. Reduce the amount of workflows files.

### Description of the Change

- Removed logger config from Client config

#### Why remove?

AFAIK Rust libraries are [disallowed](https://crates.io/crates/log#usage) to activate logs by themself. Binaries should enable it. And user should decide if he want to run with logs and with which level of logs.

You can try to create a binary, import `iroha_client` and use something like [`env_logger`](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) to enable logs. Then run your binary with `RUST_LOG=debug` env var. This will enable logs.

We don't have a lot of logs inside our `iroha_client` crate so that you won't see much of them, especially if you are not doing something. But in you can experiment with some methods or insert your logs in `iroha_client` crate manually to see, that it works.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

- Closes #2734

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- No more useless config

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### LTS update?

I don't think, that this is an important fix. I just remove what does not work. I don't think we need a PR into `iroha2-lts`, but if you insist, I can do that
