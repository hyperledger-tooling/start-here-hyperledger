                ## Description

New features:

- `GET /status` accepts `application/x-parity-scale` content type and responds accordingly
- `GET /status/<field>` now accepts nested paths, e.g. `/status/uptime/secs`

__Breaking changes:__

- `GET /status/<field>` used to be forgiving for path-not-found and serialization errors. Now it returns 404 and 500 errors accordingly.

### Linked issue

Closes #3964

### Benefits

JavaScript SDK can use `/status` endpoint without hacks around JSON parsing.

### Checklist

- [x] Open a PR into documentation
  - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/pull/422
- [x] Manually check the behaviour of `/status` endpoint

Two previous pull requests for the issue were closed without merge because of conflicts and messy commit histories. See #3919 #3920 . I have followed all the discussed steps in #3920 but some tests (in `mod.rs`) are still failing.


### Linked issue

This query was introduced only for the purposes of validator. Since #3442 we can use `FindAssetDefinitionById` to do the exact same thing.

Closes #3874

                ## Description

Currently each branch (`iroha2-<lts|stable|dev>`) has set of docker-compose files not only for itself, but for other branches too. It leads to confusion and goes against how versioning works. Moreover, since `2.0` release will be relatively soon and we are going to get rid of channels at all, there is no sense to keep them in the dev branch.

This PR removes docker-compose files related to other branches/channels, and removes `.dev` suffix from the configurations related to `dev` branch.

### Linked issue

Closes #3889 (will be completely closed after merging into `iroha2-stable`)

### Benefits

Less confusion, natural branch-based versioning and CI checks

### Checklist

- [ ] Add CI check to ensure usage of a proper Dockerhub image according to the branch
