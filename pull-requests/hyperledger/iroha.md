### Description of the Change

Emphasized that pg_opt are depricated, made example in the docs load from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/iroha/main/example/config.sample

Also fixed the `example/config.sample` so it would contain "database" parameter instead of "pg_opt".

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits

Config example will be up to date automatically. 

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

Relative links are not possible here and the absolute links to the config example should lead to the default branch, which might not be yet updated. 
Not a big issue as in the description of the parameters after the example it is possible to still add the missing parameters as they are mostly optional in cases where they are not in the default branch. 

Another one is that the example in docs was way fuller - it also included parameters that are bit too advanced for the config.sample and are not needed for, say, getting started manual. 
It is possible to fix this by adding these parameters to the config.sample if they will not break anything (like the "utility_service" one)
