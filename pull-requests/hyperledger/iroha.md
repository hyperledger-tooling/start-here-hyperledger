<!-- Just describe what you did. -->
Instead of failing with a `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` env var not found error, `kagami` now copies and builds the necessary packages for the default validator.

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

Closes #3473. <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits
`kagami` gets closer to being a location-independent executable
<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->

### Checklist

- [ ] Make sure it works with swarm, do the `swarm.rs` adjustments
- [ ] Write some tests? Needs to be integration presumably, as we're testing the executable independence
- [ ] I replied to all comments after code review, marking all implemented changes with thumbs up
