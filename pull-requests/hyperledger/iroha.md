### Description of the Change
Enable `iroha2-dev` image uploading  to Soramitsu images registry.

### Issue
Some time ago we did the same thing for `stable&lts` tags: #3049. Now we have a need to upload the `dev` tag as well. 

### Benefits

We will have the opportunity to test the freshest iroha2 features like #3120 within k8s deployment and do not encounter pulling limitation on DockerHub.

### Possible Drawbacks
None.

### Description of the Change

The issue I've been facing is how to make data model structs transparent for `iroha_core` and opaque for the client:
* wrote a simple macro that converts a struct to an opaque struct when linked without `transparent_api` feature
* `transparent_api` should only be activated by the inner libraries of Iroha
* I opted for a function like macro because I want to incorporate FFI API expansion into this macro
* rename `warp` feature flag to `http`

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

With this change we get the best of both worlds. We get opaque API for clients and transparent API for inner libraries of Iroha. I see no reason why Iroha libs wouldn't have access to inner workings of data model structs. It only forces us to clone or make weird workarounds 

### Possible Drawbacks

Not sure what can be done about opaque enums

### Description of the Change

Now we can sort by any values from metadata. Not only by u128. Also, this sorting implementation places all elements that cannot be sorted at the head of a result list. 

### Issue

Resolves #3116 

### Benefits

Better sorting feature.

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Take a look at tests in these changes.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Another design is to remove all elements that we can't sort.

### Description of the Change

I did some research and figured out that it's hard to find a synchronous library with the ability to cancel an HTTP request. I'm not sure that is possible at all (change my mind if it's not). My solution is that use crossbeam's `Select` feature and select native threads one of these listens to a cancellation channel. I write some tests and looks like this solution works fine.

### Issue

Resolves #2940

### Benefits

Now we can cancel to submit a transaction.

### Possible Drawbacks

The significant negative impact is that it spawns an extra native thread. Theoretically, if the client spawns many requests simultaneously, the OS can throw an error of spawning a native thread due to resource limitations.
Another negative impact is consuming more memory than the previous submitting design. 
Also, it adds `crossbeam` as a dependency.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Take a look at tests in the `integration::cancellation` module.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

1. Use an HTTP library that has an API to cancel requests. And replace `attohttpc` with it.
2. Make `DefaultRequestBuilder` (from http_default.rs) an asynchronous and use any async-runtime. It will be more efficient and will consume less memory, but it demands an async runtime on the client side and adds significant API changes.
3. We can also improve the current solution by using a thread pool. Need more research.
