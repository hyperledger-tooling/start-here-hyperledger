### Description of the Change

Revert some changes made to `Queue` and `Sumeragi` to bring multisignatures back. 
Turn on tests that works with multisigs.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Closes #3038.

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Multisignatures are working again. 

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

Currently all transactions are putted into the same queue, further improvement would be to introduce separate waiting buffer for the transactions that are waiting for more signatures.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

Test for multisig functionality on one peer:

```bash
cargo test --package iroha_core --lib -- queue::tests::push_multisignature_tx --exact --nocapture
```

Test for multisig transaction gossiping between multiple peers: 

```bash
cargo test --package iroha_client --test mod -- integration::multisignature_transaction::multisignature_transactions_should_wait_for_all_signatures --exact --nocapture
```

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Multi-signatures are still not handled correctly by the queue, i would suggest fix this in the separate PR.

                ### Description of the Change

Introduced a lockfile mechanism to Kura to prevent running multiple writing instances over one store.

### Issue

#3027 

### Benefits

As per #3027

### Possible Drawbacks

More complexity in Kura.

### Alternate Designs

- This PR uses typestate pattern to encode lock state in attempt to prevent accidental misuse when changing Kura code. One could argue for a simpler design that would allow slightly more room for mistakes.
- Storage is locked for full lifetime of Kura. There was an alternate design discussed where lock is acquired only when writing blocks, however it is worse for performance and still allows starting multiple Iroha instances backed by the same storage, postponing failure for indeterminate time in the future.
