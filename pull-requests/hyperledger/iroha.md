More docs

### Possible Drawbacks

### Description of the Change

Added a workflow that: 
1. Runs tests that used to be run by `test-docker`, checking for API compatibility between `iroha` and `iroha_client_cli`. 
2. Runs a benchmark. 
3. Runs an Iroha-java API-compatibility test.

This workflow triggers only when creating a release pull-request:  merging from `iroha2-dev` into `iroha2` (the "main" branch). 

### Issue
Closes #1726 

### Benefits

This is much-requested functionality that will help other SDK developers. 

### Possible Drawbacks
None

### Description of the Change

* All *WSV* `modify_` methods are now implemented through each other. New `modify_world()` is on top
* Introduce new strongly typed events
* `modify_` methods accepts closures returning strongly typed event
* Refactor filters for strongly typed events

### Issue

Resolves #1892 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

* Events are emitted only in *WSV*
* Now there is no way to call `modify_` method without event emitting
* Decreased chance to emit wrong event

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### TODO

* Fix failing tests
* Add documentation
* Rebase to the new iroha2-dev commits

### Description of the Change

Added automatic changelog generation.

### Issue

Closes #1928


<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Automatic changelog generation

### Possible Drawbacks

Changelog format is not ideal. Missing significant portion of tags. Since long commit messages are not standardised, sometimes the squashed commits contain more information than they should.

### Description of the Change

Refactored `scripts` to be more self-contained and flexible for use in GitHub actions. 

Added a version of `setup_test_env.sh` that does not require `docker-compose` and uses the debug build of Iroha.

### Issue

Closes #1902.

### Benefits

Can run tests using live iroha peers without use of Docker. Creates pathway to resolve #1726 

### Possible Drawbacks

More logic relegated to bash. 

### TODO

Cleanup. 

Test on other configurations.
