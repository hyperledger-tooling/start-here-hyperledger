### Description of the Change

The `total` is the number of values returned in the top-most level of an iterable container after applying filter and before pagination.

- Fix `total` field calculation in `handle_queries`;
- Extend test `torii_pagination` to check that `total` field value is unaffected by pagination.

### Description of the Change

- Implemented Register and Unregister instructions for Asset
- Changed minting implementation to require registering the asset first
- Adjusted public validators accordingly

### Possible Drawbacks

Register asset and Mint should now be considered together when implementing permission systems.

### Description of the Change

I added tests for permissions related to account and some asset `queries` and also for permissions related to `register`. ~~But the `OnlyAccountsDomain` and `OnlyAccountsData` permissions need to be tested on many other queries.~~(will be in the next PRs) The tests are very different and it is very difficult to write a macro that would generate that tests.

- [x] register module
- [x] tests permissions with all account related and some asset related queries
- [x] tests permissions with other queries (resolved: will be in the next PRs)
- [x] weird impl `IsAllowed` for `ProhibitRegisterDomains`

### Issue
Partially resolves #2053

### Benefits

Improved coverage

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Using macros would reduce the number of tests, but the tests are too different.

Also we can just write tests only for queries with non-trivial logic.

Resolves #2323.
<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Suggests a makeshift solution to Iroha users.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
The message could actually be somewhat misleading. If there is a network being run by `docker compose` and only one of the peers has faulty data, simply restarting it wouldn't help as it will keep crashing over and over. Maybe I'm missing out on some technique, but so far the only viable solution for me was rebuilding the network, so I made sure the message reflects that.
