### Description of the Change

1. How to encode data exchanged between smart contract and Iroha(host)?
Since serialization is too expensive (in smart contract size) and relying on the `repr(C)` ABI is not really tenable, the best technique is to use the opaque pointer approach where smart contract is given opaque pointers and a list of functions to read from or modify the object behind the opaque pointer.

2. Where should the allocated objects reside?
Using opaque pointers implies that they are created on the host side (in host's memory space) and given to the smart contract. The problem is that giving control of the host's memory to the wasm module is a potential security issue. Approach where we'll be storing/serializing allocations to the modules linear memory, if possible to implement, would be very complex. That's why I had to introduce another module which smart contract would link against. This module is responsible for allocations and shares it's linear memory with the smart contract. Having them share memories turned out to be problematic because each module would be instantiated with it's own allocator and would step over each other. That is why smart contract needed an implementation of a custom allocator which would forward all (de)allocation requests to the module responsible for handling memory. This also has the added benefit that smart contract no longer has to include allocation logic inside itself and trims a few more bytes of it.

3. There is too many functions for dealing with smartpointers
Having many function signatures bloats the smart contract binary. This can be alleviated by assigning a unique function id to every function(except a few dedicated) and multiplexing them over just one function `_iroha_fn`.

### Description of the Change

Aggregate of several refactors to `Sumeragi`, `Torii` and various fixes to `Core`. 
- Lints introduced in rust 1.59
- Sumeragi split into file-based modules. 
- Torii and related functionality split off from the `iroha_core` crate. 
- Iroha peer binary also moved into the front-end crate. 
- Various CLI fixes and error messages.
