Closes #3411.
<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

Test flakes at much smaller rate, i run it like 10000 times without any error + works a lot faster.

There still can be cases where we can lose message (and thus `multiple_networks` test can fail).

## Description

seems that disabling of wasmtime caching affects start-up time of our integration tests. My suspicion is that this is because `wasmtime` cache is shared between tests. In particular, validator from `genesis` seems to be cached.

I'll explore this after #3231 , until then I'm reverting this commit
