After successful merges:  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4003 and https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4032 I was compiling entire Iroha 1.

1. I've noticed some warning, which may cause that the command is not working properly.
2. I've also corrected warnings connected with unused includes.
3. I remember that many times I was asking @6r1d how to merge approved Pull Request, he suggested that this information should be in CONTRIBUTION.rst - so I've added its.

### Benefits
1. Fix of undetected bug
2. Faster compilation time and less warnings from IDE
3. No more questions to @6r1d about what button to press:)
