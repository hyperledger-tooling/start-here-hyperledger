<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->

### Description of the Change
Introduces Roles, which are tags for a group of permission.
The logic is that you can grant a user a role only if you can grant each of the permissions that it comprises of.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
Permissioned networks will benefit from native support of roles in Iroha2.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
Conditional compilation might introduce bugs which are difficult to detect.

Signed-off-by: i1i1 <vanyarybin1@live.ru>


### Description of the Change

Remove lock from WSV and make maps and sets mutable concurrently. It uses [dashmap](https://crates.io/crates/dashmap) crate for that. (It also uses [lockfree](https://crates.io/crates/lockfree) for the queue, stack...)

### Benefits

This change removes racing for whole wsv and adds locks for its subparts.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Lockfree actually caused several panics and needs for rework.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

[dashmap](https://crates.io/crates/dashmap) is also good, it offers entry api and some lock free functions, but there are cautions about deadlocks. It is probably a good candidate, but should be used wisely.
[lockfree](https://crates.io/crates/lockfree) is very generic and good crate, but it seems very unsafe to use it, as it can panic. Also it is quiete slow
[flurry](https://crates.io/crates/flurry) is a port of java hashmap, so it seems to be very robust, but it requires using [crossbeam epoch](https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.3/crossbeam/epoch/index.html) in api, so we need to drastically change it in order to use it.
