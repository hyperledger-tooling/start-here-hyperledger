I've tried to compile Iroha 1 with my g++ compiler
```
➜  ~ g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 11.1.0
```
And there were few compile errors because of header missing.

Here is PR with those changes, currently as draft until: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1662 would be merged, then I'll clean up the current PR.

                ### Description of the Change

- `WorldStateView::apply` produces data events via its optional `EventsSender`
- `Instruction::execute` succeeds in WSV `Diff` which converts to `Vec<Event>`

### Issue
Close #1172

### Benefits
Now clients can listen for data events;
some info about the successful result of each instruction

### Possible Drawbacks
Cloning cost of instructions for producing events

### Usage Examples or Tests
- The unit test describes `entity_scope` concept
- The integration test shows that `nested_instructions_are_flattened_into_data_events`

### Alternate Designs

- How detailed should `DataEntity` and `DataStatus` are?
  - If too deep, it leaks permission-protected data
  - If too shallow, it may be useless
- Planning to rewrite `Broker` model and remove `EventsSender`

### Description of the Change
Adds syncing node state for iroha.
Node in the state can:

    synchronize with remote nodes
    apply and validate blocks
    construct WSV

It can not:

### Description of the Change

This PR adds support for executing wasm smartcontracts to Iroha. 

Function parameters and return values are exchanged through **linear memory** via offset and length of the allocation. Since dealing with linear memory is very low-level(it's just a contiguous array of bytes) Rust types/values must be serialized to binary format before writing them to wasm memory. 

Wasm binary to be able to execute must export:
* `WASM_MAIN_FN` - function which the host calls to execute smartcontract
* `WASM_MEMORY` - linear memory (used to exchange more complex data than integers/floats)
* `WASM_ALLOC_FN` - function which hosts uses to allocate memory from wasm's linear memory


Notes:
* Note that since wasm is sandboxed there is no way for the module to get access to hosts memory.
* Writing wat directly or dealing with raw memory and manual allocation in Rust code that compiles to wasm is not a reasonable user experience. Helper functions and macros are kept for the followup PR. 
* Limits like wasm binary size and wasm fuel are added in a separate PR.

Should feature flag be introduced to include wasm support optionally?

### Issue

#1425

### Benefits

### Possible Drawbacks

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Once [WebAssembly specification](https://github.com/webassembly/interface-types) adds support for `Interface Types` it would be much better to use those because no serialization would be required and types would just flow through wasm VM without VM actually understanding their representation.

### Issue
#1751
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Fixes double spend attack, and general bug with same transaction being committed more than once. For more detailed overview please read the issue.

Previously wsv was updated after kura when it received the message from sumeragi. The bug was in the fact that sumeragi assumed it committed the block and updated its state, therefore able to approve next blocks, but the message might arrive to Kura a lot later. This made possible for the `is_in_blockchain` checks for transactions to pass sometimes even as some of them were in previous block. And therefore leaders could create blocks with same txs and other peers might approve it.

<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Description of the Change

View change handling fixes

- View change proofs made independent of particular transaction hashes
- Reduced message passing
- Collect view change votes instead of sending messages right away (improves network resilience)
- Fully use Actor framework in Sumeragi (schedule messages to self instead of task spawns)

Improves fault injection for tests with Sumeragi

- Brings testing code closer to production code
- Removes overcomplicated wrappers
- Allows Sumeragi use actor Context in test code

Batch transaction gossiping

Significantly reduces message passing

Also fixes transaction count metric calculation, which previously was providing results delayed by 1 block.

### Issue
#1715
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- Network is more resilient - will recover in cases of faulty peers or after high load (when the load normalizes)
- Network is more performant: about 2 TPS previously, now 100 TPS

For measuring TPS:
- Python script was used
- Timeouts in config were increased
- Logging level was set to `ERROR`
- 4 peers through docker compose were ran locally on a machine with 16 GB or RAM, i7 8th gen.
