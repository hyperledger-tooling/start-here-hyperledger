### Description of the Change

Initially, the task was to migrate to HL Ursa portable, to sever dependency on C libraries. 
Unfortunately, it turned out to be not the time yet, so I simply upgraded ursa version to 0.3.7 and removed all direct dependencies on ursa except for one in iroha_crypto.

### Benefits

iroha_crypto now encapsulates functionality provided by ursa (re-exports it actually) and we have a single point to set ursa version.

### Possible Drawbacks 

We should get back to the question of Rust-only solution later, possibly when Ursa will support it better.
