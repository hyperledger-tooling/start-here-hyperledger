                ### Linked issue

Closes #3383 

### Limitations

This can't replace all uses of the existing `socket_addr!` macro, as it parses only literal addresses. Some of the `socket_addr!` usages use an expression as port number: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/19984d91c2add850a197050e6cbee52af1bc6fa2/core/test_network/src/lib.rs#L598. Supporting this is possible, but would require a more complicated parser.

As 5/11 usages of the original macro use it, it probably doesn't make sense to merge it without support for variable ports

It also doesn't support hostname addresses, but they are not used anywhere except in the doc-test for the `socket_addr!` macro. Probably fine going without it, but should be relatively easy to implement if needed.

This PR adds a CI/CD check that `docker-compose.*.yml` files stored in the repo are generated with `kagami swarm` tool. This PR includes updated Docker Compose configurations as well.

### Linked issue

Closes #3648

### Benefits

It will help to be sure that those files are up-to-date, therefore to avoid confusion of any Iroha users.

### Checklist

- [ ] Ensure that the PR covers **all** Docker Compose files that should be covered.
- [ ] Discuss `docker-compose.TML.yml` in the `check.sh`
- [ ] Discuss/ensure that the check runs in the correct time, as described in #3648: selective run on changes in data model / kagami swarm code, etc

                ## Description

Now you can configure `iroha_wasm_builder` output dir in a three ways (in order of priority):

1. Explicitly use `out_dir()` method
2. Set `IROHA_WASM_BUILDER_OUT_DIR` env var
3. Do nothing if you are in a build-script. Directory will be inherited from `OUT_DIR` env var which is set by `cargo`

By default `target` directory of running crate will be used.

Other than that optimization *caching* is also implemented.
This is done by comparing `sha256` hashes of non-omptimized wasm-files. If hash before and after build are equal, then non-omptimized file wasn't changed, which means that optimized wasm file should also stay unchanged and we don't have to spent time on running `wasm-opt`.

Also `build()` will fail now if it's being called on workspace. I think, it was an error that we didn't have that before. It's an error because we run `build()` only to get `Output` from it, where `Output` is a binary encoded WASM file, which we can't choose if we build workspace.

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

- Closes #3236 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

Cached wasm binaries allows us not to rebuild them everytime from scratch. I.e. cached validator builds now take much less time. Same for tests which sumbit wasm.
