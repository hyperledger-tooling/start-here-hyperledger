### Description of the Change
I noticed that in examples queries were not working - after some time of investigation I noticed that `counter` must be greated than 0, but default  value is 0. So I changed into 1. Also I added another example file with error checking (it was my first time with GRPC in C++ so there can be errors)

### Description of the Change
Enable `iroha2-dev` image uploading  to Soramitsu images registry.

### Issue
Some time ago we did the same thing for `stable&lts` tags: #3049. Now we have a need to upload the `dev` tag as well. 

### Benefits

We will have the opportunity to test the freshest iroha2 features like #3120 within k8s deployment and do not encounter pulling limitation on DockerHub.

### Possible Drawbacks
None.

### Description of the Change

The issue I've been facing is how to make data model structs transparent for `iroha_core` and opaque for the client:
* wrote a simple macro that converts a struct to an opaque struct when linked without `transparent_api` feature
* `transparent_api` should only be activated by the inner libraries of Iroha
* I opted for a function like macro because I want to incorporate FFI API expansion into this macro
* rename `warp` feature flag to `http`

### Issue

Closes #3127

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

With this change we get the best of both worlds. We get opaque API for clients and transparent API for inner libraries of Iroha. I see no reason why Iroha libs wouldn't have access to inner workings of data model structs. It only forces us to clone or make weird workarounds 

### Possible Drawbacks

Not sure what can be done about opaque enums
