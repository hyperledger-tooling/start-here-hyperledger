* Move `World` from `data_model` into `wsv` as it will never be used by clients. 
* Implement `IntoSchema` for blocks and transitive dependencies as a preparation for block streaming
* rename `Query` -> `ExecutableQuery`, `QueryOutput` -> `Query`
* fix `roles` feature inconsistencies
* move some transaction structures to `data_model`. Will be used for block streaming

### Description of the Change

1. Fixes a bug accidentally introduced by FuturesUnordered pr
2. Fixes usual failures of `unregister_peer` test, which did not wait for needed amount of time

### Bug Description

In `test_network` and `sumeragi_with_mock` tests in several places there were dependencies on particular order of the responses that `Network::send` (now `Network::send_to_actors_on_peers`) would return. With introduction of `FuturesUnordered` the order is now random there, so tests started failing from time to time.

The general problem was that code that used the function assumed a specific behavior of the function which was neither documented nor contained in a type.
