                ### Description of the Change

- Moved metadata module into its own file. 
- Added a `LimitedMetadata` variant  to `Value`, 
- Adding an `Unlimited` variant can cause problems in preserving code invariants.
- Added the `nested_` family of `fn`s, which all operate on a `&Path`, which is a type alias for `Vec<String>` (for now). 
- Nested get, remove and insert functions fail fast if the path is either empty, incorrect, or malformed. 
- Added tests to verify functionality. 


### Issue

Closes #1144 

### Benefits

Nested metadata. 

### Possible Drawbacks

None

### Description of the Change

- Refactored metric storage. 
- Added more metrics. 
- Added instrumentation for easily tracking `query` and `isi` execution and timing, via `iroha_telemetry_derive` procedural macro crate. 
- Full metrics are hidden behind the `expensive-telemetry` feature flag for core. Without this flag the `metrics` macro checks, if it's properly applied, but doesn't record the metrics. 


### Issue

Resolves #1331 


### Benefits

More metrics

### Possible Drawbacks
Tracking `expensive-telemetry` metrics slows down all instrumented `isi` and `query` implementations. 

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

```rust
#[metrics(
   "a", 
   "bunch_of_metrics",
   "ordered_freely", 
   "only_the_timed", 
  +"have_a_plus", 
  +"which_looks_like_a_t"
)]
```

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Instrumentation can be added by changing the trait topology for Queries and ISI.
