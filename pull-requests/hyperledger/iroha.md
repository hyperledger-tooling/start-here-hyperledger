<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change

- Add `ConstString`: immutable, inlinable string, which uses `union` internally to store boxed and inlined variants in the same space;
- Replace `String` with `ConstString` in `Name` struct.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Closes #1985.

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

All structs that uses `Name` take up less space.
We win at least one machine word for every instance of `Name` and up to 23 byte for strings 15 bytes long on 64-bit architecture, also strings shorter than 15 bytes are stored on the stack, which avoids allocation.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

`ConstString` uses `unsafe` code, which increases the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

```
cargo test --package iroha_data_primitives --lib -- conststr::tests --nocapture
```

### Alternate Designs

It possible to use enum instead of union to avoid `unsafe`, but it take 24 bytes instead of 16, [see](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=a28c4bfc22d99f5808638dcc82c46553).

This is a draft for now. I need to clean up everything and document the code. Also, I suggest extending [the fork of `unique_port`](https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha2-unique_port) with my changes, instead of copy-pasting it here to extend it.
