                ## Description

- Revised all `no_std` constructions in data_model.
- Also did that for other crates, but there was nothing to change.

<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

### Linked issue

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

- Closes #3714  <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

- Signature verification in `no_std` environment

<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->

### Checklist

- [x] I've read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [x] I've used the standard signed-off commit format (or will squash just before merging)
- [x] All applicable CI checks pass (or I promised to make them pass later)
- [ ] (optional) I've written unit tests for the code changes
- [ ] I replied to all comments after code review, marking all implemented changes with thumbs up
