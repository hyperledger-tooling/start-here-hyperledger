### Description of the Change

I've found that often times I need to traverse the type and produce conversions from source to FFI compliant type and vice versa.
There have been a lot of code duplication and convoluted logic which this PR aims to resolve
Added `catch_unwind` to prevent UB when panicking over FFI

### Description of the Change

- Add `Role`-related match arm in `UnregisterBox` execution;
- Fix `Unregister<Role>::execute` by: 
    - removing double deletion of role from account;
    - returning correct event after revoking role from account;
    - correctly early exiting if role doesn't exist;
- Add `Role`-related queries to client;
- Add tests:
    - to check that role removed from account after unregistering;
    - to check `Role`-related queries.

### Description of the Change

Issue #1896 occured because `produce_event` function has misleading statement: 

```rust
return warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
```
So to avoid confusion it was decided to refactor `produce_event`.

None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs

Firstly alternative `produce_event` implementation was considered, but clippy rejects it.

Clippy error: ```error: use Option::map_or_else instead of an if let/else```

Alternative implementation: 

```rust
/// Send [`Event`]s to known subscribers.
fn produce_event(&self, event: impl Into<Event>) {
    if let Some(events_sender) = &self.events_sender {
        drop(events_sender.send(event.into()));
    } else {
        warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
    }
}
```

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Description of the Change

This replaces nested methods which creates `Peer` with `PeerBuilder` structure (Builder pattern).

- [x] MVP
- [ ] CI checks pass
- [ ] Add the docs/comments

### Issue

Resolves #2238

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Makes creating a test environment more flexible and convenient.

### Possible Drawbacks

Idk may increase test run time.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Make `Peer` structure a builder itself. But in that design, will need to keep parameters (`genesis`, `configuration`, `instruction_validator`, `query_validator`, `temp_dir`) inside the `Peer` structure to start the peer's task - it will makes `Peer` structure a huge.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->
The `configuration` endpoint now returns all the inner fields as well when queried for docs.

### Issue
Resolves #1638.
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
More helpful doc API calls.

### Possible Drawbacks
The only way to return a `&'static str` while also making it custom formatted that I found was by boxing a `String` and then leaking it explicitly. Hopefully it doesn't introduce security issues.
