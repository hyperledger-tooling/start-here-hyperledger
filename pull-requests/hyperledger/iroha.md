                ## Description

I was poking around the codebase and refactored a few things:
* with `ProofBuilder` we're assured that proof always has at least one signatures
* with `BlockBuilder` only block that is chained and signed is called a block. Intermediate stages are encapsulated with the builder
* with `Candidate<B>` there is less code duplication

                ## Description

Evaluation of expressions on the host is unnecessary so it's been moved into the smart contract itself. `wsv` is only used in one expression evaluation and that is `Expression::Query`. Had we not had this expression, every expression could be evaluated deterministically(whatever the current state of the world may be)

This should not bloat the binary once dynamic linking is in place because evaluation will be taking place in the dynamically linked wasm not the smart contract itself

Closes #3349

### Benefits

* the less interaction with the host the better the performance
