UPD: this PR should be put on hold till I add changes with builders -- for convenience

### Description of the Change

Small fixes in build documentation -- to make the process of building on Linux a little clearer

### Issue

No Issue for that, just based on the experience. 

### Benefits

A little better docs

### Possible Drawbacks

Will be followed by the fixes of the same doc but about the docker builder

### Description of the Change

Introduced KURA_BLOCKS_PER_STORAGE_FILE setting which defaults to 1000 and defines number of blocks per each new created datafile. 


### Benefits

1. Persistent storage logic was reduced from "random block read/write" to "bulk read+decoding/encoding+append". It should significantly speed up read times (which is to be measured!) without any risks on write (append write of single 4Kb IO Block is usually atomic).
2. Within data file we store blocks by character count framing (u32 length + byte sequence). As a result, we don't rely on number of blocks in file for deserialization and can reconfigure this setting for node at any moment without consequences.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Since file format was modified, this change is breaking backwards compatibility

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

I have changed test read_all_blocks_from_block_store accordingly.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Embedded DB is a good alternative, and definitely IS a better alternative if we'll eventually need random access to serialized blocks.

Fix display of logs with log level less than info.
