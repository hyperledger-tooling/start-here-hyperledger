                ## Description

This PR splits Torii (web server functionality), located in the main CLI, into a separate `iroha_torii` crate.

The rationale is to make a step towards making the main CLI exclusively a binary. Currently `iroha` is a library as well, exposing functionality to run `Iroha` in tests. That includes Torii. Since Torii is quite self-contained, making it a separate crate seem to make sense.

A further step would be to move `Iroha` itself and `iroha::samples` out of the CLI, so that `test_network` doesn't depend on `iroha` anymore, and `iroha` might be exclusively a binary.

Additionally:

- fix `telemetry` feature flag. Torii code didn't compile if this feature was disabled.
- clean dependencies of `iroha` CLI

Re-exported does not have the TLS fully functional if we only enable it on `tokio-tungstenite`, so a direct dependency is required

This PR removes auto-generated configuration reference and everything related to it.

The motivation is to make one step forward towards the new reference (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/392). 

After merge of this PR, there will be no configuration reference available for some time. We decided that it is fine and will streamline further process according to the RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/2585).

Should be reviewed and merged after:
