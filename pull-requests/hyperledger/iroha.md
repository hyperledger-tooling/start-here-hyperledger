This PR removes auto-generated configuration reference and everything related to it.

The motivation is to make one step forward towards the new reference (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/392). 

After merge of this PR, there will be no configuration reference available for some time. We decided that it is fine and will streamline further process according to the RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/2585).

Should be reviewed and merged after:
