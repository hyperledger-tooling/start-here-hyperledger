While original issues doesn't state it clearly I think that the problem was premature execution of time triggers.
So that trigger could be executed even before `start`. I fixed this.

- Now it's forbidden to register schedule-based time-trigger with `start` point before `latest_block_timestamp + consensus_estimation` time, where `consensus_estimation = 4 secs` and is a hardcoded constant. Everithing before this timestamp is considered already analyzed by Iroha. In other words -- **time-triggers in the past are forbidden**.
- As a consequence it's forbidden to register such trigger in genesis
- Now premature time-trigger look up is forced to not to execute trigger `start` point is in future
- This behavior is tested by a fixed `change_asset_metadata_after_1_sec` test

Forbidding time-triggers in the past was the simpliest solution and I actually think it was making sence to implement that in the initial solution.

### Benefits

- Less confusion about time-trigger execution time
- No more painful triggers in the past
