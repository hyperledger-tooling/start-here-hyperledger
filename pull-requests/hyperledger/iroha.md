It's quite easily possible to forget to include ui tests due to misconfiguration. Sticking with this convention would lower the possibility for that. We could also watch for `There are no trybuild tests enabled yet.` line in the CI as this would indicate no ui tests are actually being run even though `trybuild` is configured
