### Description of the Change

Incorporate the indirect dependencies: `smallvec` and `smallstr` into main iroha code. 
Measured a performance uplift of 10% ± 1%, measured using `torii` benchmark. 

Added extra crate for data primitives not directly related to `iroha_data_model`, called `iroha_data_primitives`. 

### Issue

Closes #1790.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
More performance

### Possible Drawbacks
 More work for library developers. 
 
 ### Tests
 
 ```
 cd client
 cargo bench # cargo bench torii will result in no runs executed. 
 ```

### Description of the Change

* fixed `IntoSchema` representation of some types
* added test to verify all types are present in the schema
* added `IntoSchema` for `MerkleTree<VersionedTransaction>` and `VersionedValidBlock`

Schemas of `MerkleTree` and `VersionedValidBlock` are not necessary for client/server communication because only their hashes are exhanged as in `HashOf<T>`. However, it may make sense for the client to validate the hashes and to do so it would need the format of the structure for which the hash is calculated.

I could have enforced that schema of `T` for every `T` in `HashOf<T>` be present in the schema. I didn't want to guarantee that schema is provided for every hashed structure. Would this be preferred?

`Hash<32>` will be added in a separate PR because the change is more complex
