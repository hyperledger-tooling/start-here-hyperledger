Closes #1153

### Description of the Change
Recursive check for query permissions inside of instructions
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
We have nested expressions which might also contain queries that have to be checked accordingly.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks
The checks are recursive which means with high nestedness they might cause stack overflow. This has to be prevented by max instruction number config or a special config for max nested instructions number.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
