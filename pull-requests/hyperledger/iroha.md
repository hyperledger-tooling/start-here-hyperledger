            <td>
                ## Description

New features:

- `GET /status` accepts `application/x-parity-scale` content type and responds accordingly
- `GET /status/<field>` now accepts nested paths, e.g. `/status/uptime/secs`

__Breaking changes:__

- `GET /status/<field>` used to be forgiving for path-not-found and serialization errors. Now it returns 404 and 500 errors accordingly.

### Linked issue

Closes #3964

### Benefits

JavaScript SDK can use `/status` endpoint without hacks around JSON parsing.

### Checklist

- [x] Open a PR into documentation
  - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/pull/422
- [x] Manually check the behaviour of `/status` endpoint

                ### Notes
Two previous pull requests for the issue were closed without merge because of conflicts and messy commit histories. See #3919 #3920 . I have followed all the discussed steps in #3920 but some tests (in `mod.rs`) are still failing.


### Linked issue

This query was introduced only for the purposes of validator. Since #3442 we can use `FindAssetDefinitionById` to do the exact same thing.

Closes #3874
