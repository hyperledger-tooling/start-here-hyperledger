                ## Description

1. Remove coveralls tool for coverage since it's useless while having it in the workflow trigger type (btw, it's still might be possible to fix). However, coverage is uploading in Sonarqube now.
2. Modify concurrency.
3. Run clippy and lcov jobs in the head branch context.
4. Remove defecdojo output print.
5. Trigger workflow within one parent workflow onlyto reduce parallel jobs creation.


### Benefits

Remove coveralls that doesn't work.
Reduce the possible amount of parallel runs of I2::Dev::CodeQuality workflow.

### Checklist

- [ ] I've read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] I've used the standard signed-off commit format (or will squash just before merging)
- [ ] All applicable CI checks pass (or I promised to make them pass later)
- [ ] (optional) I've written unit tests for the code changes
- [ ] I replied to all comments after code review, marking all implemented changes with thumbs up

This PR is a first step towards more type-safe queries (#4569). It adds traits for singular and iterable queries and prohibits supplying filters, sorting, pagination and batching parameters in compile time (it is already a runtime error to do so).

### Linked issue

Partially addresses #4569

### Benefits

- less error prone API
- lays foundation to allow type-checking query filters

                ## Description

Added a method to retrieve a pending partially signed transaction by its transaction hash from the queue. Previously, existing methods required the entire transaction payload, which was cumbersome for other users who needed to build the entire transaction for signing. Now, only the transaction hash is needed.

### Benefits

This improvement simplifies the process for users who need to sign transactions, as they no longer need to reconstruct the entire transaction payload. Instead, they can simply use the transaction hash. This change aligns more closely with real-world use cases, making the signing process more practical and efficient.

Just a huge rename refactor, according to https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4597#discussion_r1607746197. This should significantly reduce the noise of #4597 itself.

While working on #4599, I noticed that in custom executor it is possible to derive `Visit` with invalid `#[visit(custom())]` functions which will be ignored (only rustc error that function is unused). This PR adds check for custom visit function names to avoid potential bugs. Also I updated documentation of some proc-macros related to custom executor.

```rust
#[derive(Constructor, ValidateEntrypoints, Validate, Visit)]
#[visit(custom(visit_register_domain2))]  // typo in visit_register_domain
struct Executor {
    verdict: Result,
    block_height: u64,
}
fn visit_register_domain(...) { ... }
```
