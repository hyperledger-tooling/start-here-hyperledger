<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change

* All *WSV* `modify_` methods are now implemented through each other. New `modify_world()` is on top
* Introduce new strongly typed events
* `modify_` methods accepts closures returning strongly typed event
* Refactor filters for strongly typed events

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->

### Issue

Resolves #1892 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

* Events are emitted only in *WSV*
* Now there is no way to call `modify_` method without event emitting
* Decreased chance to emit wrong event

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### TODO

* Fix failing tests
* Add documentation
* Rebase to the new iroha2-dev commits

### Description of the Change

Added automatic changelog generation.

### Issue

Closes #1928


<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Automatic changelog generation

### Possible Drawbacks

Changelog format is not ideal. Missing significant portion of tags. Since long commit messages are not standardised, sometimes the squashed commits contain more information than they should.

### Description of the Change

Refactored `scripts` to be more self-contained and flexible for use in GitHub actions. 

Added a version of `setup_test_env.sh` that does not require `docker-compose` and uses the debug build of Iroha.

### Issue

Closes #1902.

### Benefits

Can run tests using live iroha peers without use of Docker. Creates pathway to resolve #1726 

### Possible Drawbacks

More logic relegated to bash. 

### TODO

Cleanup. 

Test on other configurations.
