UPD: this PR should be put on hold till I add changes with builders -- for convenience

### Description of the Change

Small fixes in build documentation -- to make the process of building on Linux a little clearer

### Issue

No Issue for that, just based on the experience. 

### Benefits

A little better docs

### Possible Drawbacks

Will be followed by the fixes of the same doc but about the docker builder
