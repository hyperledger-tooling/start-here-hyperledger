#### [feature] #2085: Authenticate personal accounts by ID

This is a milestone for the following commit. The inclusion of the public key in the ID allows the ID to match the verifying key of the signature. This makes it possible to authenticate transactions and queries with the ID alone.

- `api-changes`: single signatory account, single signature transaction
- `api-changes`: remove query `FindAccountsByName`
- `config-changes`: client config `account.id` changes to `account.domain_id`
- add `iroha_sample_params` utility for tests
- different notions of signatories "peer", "genesis", and "alice" in the test network

#### [feature] #2085: Auto-register destination account on transfer

Includes registration of the destination account in the transfer execution. The main use case is described in test `auto_register_account::on_transfer::asset_numeric`

### Linked issue

- This is the 1st of the 3-part work of account restructuring:
  - Closes #2085
  - #4372
  - #4373
- Opens #4410
- Contains suggestions for #4409

### Benefits

As long as you know the address (account ID), you can send without worrying whether the destination account is already registered on the chain.
However, the current design requires the sender to be authorized to register a new account within the domain. See https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4411#discussion_r1552269607

### Drawbacks

- Conventional `name@domain` notation will be temporary lost
  - For dev use, introduces an utility `iroha_sample_params::alias`
  - To be restored with #4372
- Multi-signature functionality will be temporary lost, coupled with [the queue change](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4308)
  - To be restored and enhanced with #4373

                    [fix] #4307: Pad `r` and `s` to 32 bytes in `secp256k1_sign` test

                ## Description

Currently, the `signature::secp256k1::test::secp256k1_sign` test fails intermittently due to `r` sometimes producing a vector of 31 bytes instead of 32, which makes `EcdsaSecp256k1Sha256::verify` fail on the total `r + s` length check (==64). 

Maybe it's possible that `s` does the same, so I padded `s` too to be safe â€“ but I don't have the cryptography background to confirm that (failing cases have pointed to `r` only). I'm also unaware if it's possible for `r` or `s` to be >32 bytes long.

### Linked issue

Closes #4307.

### Benefits

Test should no longer be flaky.

This PR adds a `TimeSource` to `iroha_primitives` - a mockable time source. It then proceeds to make the queue tests use the mock time source to make them deterministic.

Previously iroha tried to connect indefinitely to idle peer.

Introduce idle timeout for p2p communication:

Each peer track the last time it received message (or ping) from particular peer, if this time is larger than timeout peer is disconnected.

If no other messages were produced in time equal to half timeout ping is send to prove that peer isn't idle.

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### How to test

1. setup iroha network with multiple peers using `LOGLEVEL=TRACE ./scripts/test_env.py setup`
2. kill one of the peers (e.g. iroha1)
3. start listening on p2p port this peer was using `nc -l 1338`
4. check that peers terminate connection with this "peer" after timeout
