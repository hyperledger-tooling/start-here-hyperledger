                Let's update the Docker container names as we need to.
For the context, I left `hyperledger/` prefix in configurations that used it previously.
(What if somebody creates another `iroha2:dev` or `iroha2:stable` container on Dockerhub?)

                ## Description

New features:

- `GET /status` accepts `application/x-parity-scale` content type and responds accordingly
- `GET /status/<field>` now accepts nested paths, e.g. `/status/uptime/secs`

__Breaking changes:__

- `GET /status/<field>` used to be forgiving for path-not-found and serialization errors. Now it returns 404 and 500 errors accordingly.

### Linked issue

Closes #3964

### Benefits

JavaScript SDK can use `/status` endpoint without hacks around JSON parsing.

### Checklist

- [x] Open a PR into documentation
  - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/pull/422
- [x] Manually check the behaviour of `/status` endpoint
