                ## Description

This change allow to preserve voting block during block sync until iroha have to drop it to process transactions.

It is done in two ways: 
1. check block signatures before verification
2. try verify block without discarding voting block

<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

### Linked issue

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

Closes #4834 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

Preserve voting block in more cases.

### Downsides

Resulting code is not pretty.
Because it has to handle soft-fork case explicitly and not just revert previous block and proceed.

### How To Test

```
cargo test --package iroha_core --lib -- sumeragi::main_loop::tests::block_sync_commit_err_keep_voting_block --exact --show-output
```

This fixes the error with `cargo install`:

```bash
package `.../client/tests/integration/smartcontracts/executor_custom_data_model/Cargo.toml` is a member of the wrong workspace
```

I'm not sure what exactly fixed it. It wasn't enough to just exclude it from the main `Cargo.toml`, maybe the additional unnesting did it.

- move all binary crates to `/bins`
- move all library crates to `/libs`
- move executors, smart contracts and triggers to `/samples`
- unnest `iroha_executor` and `iroha_trigger` from `iroha_smart_contract`
- rename crate directories to match their actual names (except nested utility crates)
- rename `configs` to `defaults`, remove `swarm` directory

### Linked issue

Closes #4293, #4320

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

- binaries can be installed with `cargo install`
- separation between binaries and libraries
- more predictable structure and names

Originally `kura.lock` [was introduced](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/3027) to prevent multiple iroha instances running with the same data directory. However if iroha doesn't remove `kura.lock`, e.g. in case of non-graceful shutdown, it causes problem that iroha couldn't start after restart. Also usually iroha is deployed using k8s cluster where each peer lives in different container so original problem is not relevant in this case. So it is proposed to remove `kura.lock`.

### Linked issue

### Benefits

Remove `kura.lock`, allowing Iroha to restart after non-graceful shutdown

<p>Deserialize a map` and skip all elements failing to deserialize by <a href="https://github.com/johnmave126"><code>@â€‹johnmave126</code></a> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/jonasbb/serde_with/issues/763">#763</a>)</p>
<p><code>MapSkipError</code> acts like a map (<code>HashMap</code>/<code>BTreeMap</code>), but keys or values that fail to deserialize, like are ignored.</p>
<p>For formats with heterogeneously typed maps, we can collect only the elements where both key and value are deserializable.
This is also useful in conjunction to <code>#[serde(flatten)]</code> to ignore some entries when capturing additional fields.</p>

&quot;value&quot;: {&quot;0&quot;: &quot;v0&quot;, &quot;5&quot;: &quot;v5&quot;, &quot;str&quot;: &quot;str&quot;, &quot;10&quot;: 2},
<p>// Rust
#[serde_as(as = &quot;MapSkipError&lt;DisplayFromStr, _&gt;&quot;)]

Replace level filter with `EnvFilter` which support setting specific log level for different iroha modules.

## Examples

The same can be done through configuration in config.toml.

```bash
# set global logging level to debug
LOG_LEVEL="debug" ./scripts/test_env.py setup
# set global logging level to error and info for iroha_core
LOG_LEVEL="error,iroha_core=info" ./scripts/test_env.py setup
# receive only logs from sumerag with trace level or heigher
LOG_LEVEL="iroha_core::sumeragi" ./scripts/test_env.py setup
# receive all logs at trace level, except axum for which use error
LOG_LEVEL="trace,axum=error" ./scripts/test_env.py setup
```

Closes #4829 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

More granular control over logging.

### Downsides

It's harder to check correctness for example if someone would write `LOG_LEVEL=infa` iroha won't return any error because this would be parsed as accept logs from module `infa` at `trace` level.

I believe we can mitigate this, by custom parsing, but it would make our type more strict than orginal `EnvFilter`.
It's smt i would prefer to leave for separate PR.

                # Description

This PR introduces a lot of changes to the query subsystem. I tried to make the changes gradually in smaller PRs, but it ended up being very intertwined =(

## Summary of changes
- Queries are now split into two categories: iterable queries which return sequences of results and singular queries that return a single value. They are now fully disjoint traits stored in different Box enums, as they require very different handling.
- Query filters (aka predicates) are now typed depending on the type of the iterable query they are applied to (#4569). Instead of a single `PredicateBox` there is a predicate type for each queryable type (like `AccountPredicateBox`), with `CompountPredicate<T>` providing the logical operations on top.
- A new rust DSL to construct the predicates is introduced. It is designed to look very close to how one would write an `Iterator::filter` closure (`|obj| obj.field.inner_field.starts_with("hello")`) and is inspired by diesel's DSL.
- HTTP clients and wasm code (smart contracts, triggers and executor) are now using a common query builder struct, generic over a new `QueryExecutor` trait
- The HTTP API is majorly revamped to pass all of the params as scale-encoded values. This simplifies the torii handler, makes it more type-safe (can't add pagination to singular query) and allows sharing more code with wasm
- All of the queries that can be implemented as filtered versions of other queries are now removed. Here's a rough google table I made to keep track of all of them: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cx9cU4wLk1ZyIa3Igx0NN9azl9dfqcXXMJMLKTMxes4/edit?usp=sharing

### The primary key question

Currently we have a bunch of queries that give you an object using its Primary Key (like `FindAccountById`). They can be implemented by filtering a basis query that returns all objects of such type (like `FindAllAccounts`). However, with naÃ¯ve implementation (which this PR currently does) this would result in `O(n)` complexity instead of `O(log n)` that we currently have.

There is a way to do these lookups fast: just pattern-match the filter on the shape `|obj| obj.id.eq(expected_id)` and use the primary key index instead of linear scan. We can even use a similar approach to speed up other types of queries, if deemed necessary.

However, merging it as-is would mean that the primary queries would be slow. I can probably add the PK queries back for now, if that's unacceptable.

## Future work

These are improvements I see that can be made to this PR, but I would prefer them to be implemented in separate PRs. I'll convent them to issues when this PR gets closer to getting merged.

Perf:
- the Primary Key optimization (see above)
- make queries truly lazy (put them into the query store without collecting them all in a vec); Needs investigation whether that'll actually be beneficial and some clever implementation (need to store an iterator with lifetime tied to iroha state snapshot).

Ergonomics:
- `client::account::all()` is unfortunate, seeing as how most of the queries would be "all" with filters now
- provide helpers like `client::domain::by_id`, with them still relying on filtered queries
- `impl Into<String>` for ids (#4832)

Misc:
- `Display` representations for queries & filters (right now printing them with `Debug`)
- check that the iterable query continuation is executed by the same authority as the one that started it

## Linked issue

Closes #4569, #4720, #3720, #3671.

## Checklist

I still have a lot of doc strings, an overview of the predicate DSL implementation and some tests to write, hence marking this PR as a draft.

- [ ] add more docs and remove all the `#[warn(missing_docs)]`
- [ ] add more tests of the DSL
- [ ] add a test checking the validation performed on `SignedQueryCandidate`
- [ ] fix client cli tests
- [ ] fix ui tests
- [ ] make CI pass
