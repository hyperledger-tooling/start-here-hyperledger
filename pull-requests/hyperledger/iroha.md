### Description of the Change

I've found that often times I need to traverse the type and produce conversions from source to FFI compliant type and vice versa.
There have been a lot of code duplication and convoluted logic which this PR aims to resolve

### Description of the Change

- Add `Role`-related match arm in `UnregisterBox` execution;
- Fix `Unregister<Role>::execute` by: 
    - removing double deletion of role from account;
    - returning correct event after revoking role from account;
    - correctly early exiting if role doesn't exist;
- Add `Role`-related queries to client;
- Add tests:
    - to check that role removed from account after unregistering;
    - to check `Role`-related queries.

### Description of the Change

I've changed the waiting time (`thread::sleep`) for blocks to appear in WSV. The value is twice bigger, so I expect it will work on machines twice slower.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

As described in the ticket, `cargo bench` panicked. It turned out the panic caused by too little time of waiting for blocks to appear in WSV.
<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

It should fix the bug.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

The needed time may vary from machine to machine. As for now I don't know how everything works exactly, I can only guess that it's because of the time of blocks validation. So it may fail on slower machines, and then we need to increase the value again. Also, it slows down the benchmarks.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

None.
<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

We may provide an optional config for benchmarks through an environment variable, for example, with the sleep time.
<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Description of the Change

Issue #1896 occured because `produce_event` function has misleading statement: 

```rust
return warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
```
So to avoid confusion it was decided to refactor `produce_event`.

None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs

Firstly alternative `produce_event` implementation was considered, but clippy rejects it.

Clippy error: ```error: use Option::map_or_else instead of an if let/else```

Alternative implementation: 

```rust
/// Send [`Event`]s to known subscribers.
fn produce_event(&self, event: impl Into<Event>) {
    if let Some(events_sender) = &self.events_sender {
        drop(events_sender.send(event.into()));
    } else {
        warn!("wsv does not equip an events sender");
    }
}
```

### Description of the Change

This replaces nested methods which creates `Peer` with `PeerBuilder` structure (Builder pattern).

- [x] MVP
- [ ] CI checks pass
- [ ] Add the docs/comments

### Issue

Resolves #2238

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Makes creating a test environment more flexible and convenient.

### Possible Drawbacks

Idk may increase test run time.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Make `Peer` structure a builder itself. But in that design, will need to keep parameters (`genesis`, `configuration`, `instruction_validator`, `query_validator`, `temp_dir`) inside the `Peer` structure to start the peer's task - it will makes `Peer` structure a huge.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
More helpful doc API calls.

### Possible Drawbacks
The only way to return a `&'static str` while also making it custom formatted that I found was by boxing a `String` and then leaking it explicitly. Hopefully it doesn't introduce security issues.

### Description of the Change
This PR introduces `current_block_hash` field to `BlockHeaderValue`. This field contains the hash of the latest `VersionComittedBlock`. 
### Issue
When we query for block headers we cannot reliably compute the hash of the block, since it's computed from the byte representation of the block and can be architecture dependent.
### Benefits
The Hash of a block will no longer be architecture dependent. 
### Possible Drawbacks
Not that I know of.

### Description of the Change

While working on #2199 me and @appetrosyan have decided to split this work on several PRs, so that it will be easier to review.

We can't properly deserialize generics so we decided to make them be enum instead (at least there aren't much of things that needs permissions). It looks not so pretty, but it *much* easier to use with deserialization.

`permissions.rs` file now is very big, so I believe we should split it later. I don't do it now so that it will be easier to review (I hope)

Another important thing -- `World`s... The idea of mocking `World` with `WorldTrait` is quite painfull... I have created a new `MockWorld` but it's not used anywere yet. I'm not sure if we really need it.
Removing `W: WorldTrait` generic in some places and leaving it in another places causes me to use very wierd `W == World` runtime checks in 3 places. But it works fine for now.
The whole mocking architecture should be refactored here -- @appetrosyan  has some ideas.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Next steps

After merging this PR I'm gonna work on actual validators deserialization. It's probably gonna be another config named `permissions.json`. It will be implemented with another enum containing all possible validators from `permission_validators` folder.

### Issue

* Refers to #2199

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

* Easier to deserialize validators in the future

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

* More code doing pretty the same as before
* Wierd `W == World` checks in 3 places
