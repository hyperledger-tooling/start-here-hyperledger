### Benefits

Consensus critical configuration params now controlled by consensus, thus no forks due to divergences in this parameters. 

### Drawbacks

We will try to update parameters after every committed block, but block commit is not that frequent event so it should be fine.

Yet another `RefCell` inside `WorldStateView`.
