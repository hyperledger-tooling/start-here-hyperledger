### Description of the Change
This is prove of concept for extending queries with time interval (from,to). Protobufs were modified and some basic logic was added. Validation of passed strings is not provided yet. Modified queries are getAccountTransactions and GetAccountAssetTransactions
Protobufs were modified, then neccesary getters were added.
Passed parameters are attached to sql query in executeTransactionsQuery, by applyer lamba function,
created separately in each function

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits

 What benefits will be realized by the code change? 
Allowing to query for Transactions in given time interval
### Possible Drawbacks 

What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? 
Usage of many if's in GetAccountTransactions/GetAccountAssetTransactions in postgres_specific_query_executor.cpp
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
By rebuilding python library with protbuffs from code you can use it in Python library
<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->


### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
Usage of different types for passing data as timestamp was considered, but I decided to use string, as it is not needed to cast from int to string
