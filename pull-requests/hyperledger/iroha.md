                [ci]: Update iroha2 `I2::Dev::Publish` and `I2::Release::Publish` workflows.

## Description
1. Fix I2:Release `configs` job.
2. Remove `coveralls` badge (it works only on the default repository branch).
3. Remove `load-rs` CI dispatch trigger workflow (there is no need to trigger load-rs script build anymore).
4. Fix iroha2 user rootless `GID` inside i2 Alpine image.
5. Modify iroha2:stable and iroha2:lts images tags. Now it will be `iroha2:stable-2.0.0-pre-rc.18` or  `iroha2:lts-2.0.0-pre-rc.19`tags. I think there is not a read need to add `${{ github.sha }}` there into tags names like `lts-${{ env.VERSION }}-${{ github.sha }}`.

                ## Description

Added new type of event `NotificationEvent` and split event filters into 2 types which can be attached to trigger and which can't.

<!-- Just describe what you did. -->

<!-- Skip if the title of the PR is self-explanatory -->

### Linked issue

<!-- Duplicate the main issue and add additional issues closed by this PR. -->

Closes #2885 <!-- Replace with an actual number,  -->

<!-- Link if e.g. JIRA issue or  from another repository -->

### Benefits

More detailed information about operation of iroha node.

### Drawbacks

Emitting events has non-zero cost.

I'm not entirely sure that splitting event filters into triggerable and ordinary once is wroth it (since it require some code duplication) + not sure why we should omit attaching trigger to notification events.

<!-- EXAMPLE: users can't revoke their own right to revoke rights -->

### How to test

* Run tests:

```bash
# run integration tests
cargo test --package iroha_client --test mod -- integration::events::notification --nocapture 

# run unit test for filter matching
cargo test --package iroha_data_model --features transparent_api --lib -- events::notification::tests::trigger_completed_events_filter --exact --nocapture
```

* On live iroha node:
1. Start iroha
2. Register some triggers

register_trigger_failbox.json
```json
[
    {
        "Register": {
            "Trigger": {
            "Raw": {

                "metadata": {}
                }

                        }
                        }
                    }
                    ]
                },
                "repeats": "Indefinitely",

                "filter": {
                    "ExecuteTrigger": {
                    "trigger_id": "mint_rose",
                    "authority": "alice@wonderland"
                    }
                },
                "metadata": {}
                }
            }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

```bash
cat ./register_trigger_failbox.json | ./iroha_client_cli json
cat ./register_trigger_mint.json | ./iroha_client_cli json
```

3. Start listening for events 

```bash
./iroha_client_cli events notification
```

4. Trigger trigger execution

execute_trigger_failbox.json
```json
[
    {
        "ExecuteTrigger": {
            "TriggerId": "fail_box"
        }
    }
]
```

execute_trigger_mint.json
```json
[
    {
        "ExecuteTrigger": {
            "TriggerId": "mint_rose"
        }
    }
]
```

```bash
cat ./execute_trigger_failbox.json | ./iroha_client_cli json
cat ./execute_trigger_mint.json | ./iroha_client_cli json
```

5. Check command from step 3. for presence of events in the output

### Checklist

- [x] Add `NotificationEvent` and it's filter
- [x] Emit event after trigger complition
- [x] Add unit and integration tests to cover new functionality
- [x] Add `iroha_client_cli` support for new feature

I have found an AppImage bundler for nix and converted it for use in our nix flake. You can now run `nix build .#appimage` to build the iroha node binary as an AppImage. Ideally we would build all the projects binaries but for now that was outside of my skills with nix.
