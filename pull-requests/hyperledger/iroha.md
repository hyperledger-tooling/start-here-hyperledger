### Description of the Change

- Store `BTreeSet` instead of `BTreeMap` inside `SignaturesOf`;
- Add additional state to block `ValidSignedBlock` to represent valid block that received at least one signature;
-  Store hash and signatures inside of `BlockSigned` message instead of full block.

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->

### Issue

Partially closes #2955. 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- Less space occupied by`SignaturesOf`
- Smaller `BlockSigned` messages
- Additional strong-typing check that block is signed before sending to other peers

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

`BlockCommitted` can be optimized too, but it not as straightforward as `BlockSigned` because involve block synchronization and genesis round. So the changes will come later.

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Issue
`--entrypoint irohad`  has produced `deserialization failed` bug and the docker command to start the Iroha container passes an invalid env name in this PR change the env name to align with old docs and `--entrypoint irohad` can't be used


- Fixes #2541 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- Iroha container can run normally with the command from documents
- compatible with postgres config and rockdb config

### Possible Drawbacks

**Changed**  
- hyperledger/iroha on docker hub need to be update
- env in` entrypoint.sh ` has been changed and  `--entrypoint irohad` can't be used

**Additions **
- sample config.postgres.docker has been added to directory /example
- sample config.rockdb.docker has been added to directory/example

**Deletions**
- none

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
run with `config.postgres.docker`

### Benefits

Don't rely on programmer to do revalidation and make it unavoidable through strong typing.  

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

Currently, there may be a performance penalty due to the fact that revalidation now occurs in places where it is not really necessary (would be resolved with #2955).
