### Description of the Change

Introduced KURA_BLOCKS_PER_STORAGE_FILE setting which defaults to 1000 and defines number of blocks per each new created datafile. 


### Benefits

1. Persistent storage logic was reduced from "random block read/write" to "bulk read+decoding/encoding+append". It should significantly speed up read times (which is to be measured!) without any risks on write (append write of single 4Kb IO Block is usually atomic).
2. Within data file we store blocks by character count framing (u32 length + byte sequence). As a result, we don't rely on number of blocks in file for deserialization and can reconfigure this setting for node at any moment without consequences.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Since file format was modified, this change is breaking backwards compatibility

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

I have changed test read_all_blocks_from_block_store accordingly.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Embedded DB is a good alternative, and definitely IS a better alternative if we'll eventually need random access to serialized blocks.

### Description of the Change
- Separates gossiping from round in Sumeragi (therefore fixing MST edge case) see #1433
- Fixes a `panic` in queue on `unreachble()!` macro. It seems it is quite reachable :) Under high load and due to parallelism it can be invoked. We might improve the design here later. But for now it can be just replaced with `continue`
- Adds a docker-compose-local.yml setup to build and start containers locally for testing.
### Queue Bug
#### Setup
Local machine, docker compose with local images on latest dev commit
#### Steps
Submit txs with high frequency manually through iroha_client_cli
#### Result
Several peers stop doing anything, invalid state is reported by tokio due to `unreachable` macro in queue

After fix I tested locally with the same setup to verify that it is working. Later we can try to come up with appropriate test. See next steps.
### Next Steps
This bug fixup is urgent so some of the things that might have been included in this PR were moved to separate issues:
- #1480
- #1479
