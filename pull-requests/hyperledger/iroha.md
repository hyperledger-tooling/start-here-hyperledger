### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

Each peer collects heights of all other peers and randomly chooses one of the `n` peers with largest height to send the request for latest block to. This is implemented as two independent gossipings, one for synchronizing peer block heights and one for synchronizing blocks.

### Issue

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

Closes #1236 

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

gossiping about block heights periodically sends info about all block heights from every peer to a randomly selected subset of peers. How large is this payload depends on the number of nodes in the network. Is there some estimate?
