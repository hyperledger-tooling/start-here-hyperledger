### Description of the Change

this should enable you to build on locally and deploy in docker if you build for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target. This may not always be the case because it links statically against glibc so there can arise version mismatch. In this case you can build for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target which is links to libc statically

building in docker would bloat the container size so I haven't included cargo or rustc in the docker image, but you can install them if you find it easier to build inside docker
