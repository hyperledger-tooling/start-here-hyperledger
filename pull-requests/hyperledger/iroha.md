<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change

- Add queue size to metrics;
- Fix Queue to correctly remove transactions;
- Change behavior of the queue not to preserve all transactions until they added to the blockchain: This was redundant since transactions are putted into the sumeragi transactions cache and we don't want to repeatedly trying to put transaction duplicate into the cache. 

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

Closes #2963.

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

- No infinite growth of the transaction queue;
- More diagnostic information in the `/status` response.  

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Queue size field in the status response: 
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8180/status
```

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Multi-signatures are still not handled correctly by the queue, i would suggest fix this in the separate PR.   

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

                ### Description of the Change

Introduced a lockfile mechanism to Kura to prevent running multiple writing instances over one store.

### Issue

#3027 

### Benefits

As per #3027

### Possible Drawbacks

More complexity in Kura.

### Alternate Designs

- This PR uses typestate pattern to encode lock state in attempt to prevent accidental misuse when changing Kura code. One could argue for a simpler design that would allow slightly more room for mistakes.
- Storage is locked for full lifetime of Kura. There was an alternate design discussed where lock is acquired only when writing blocks, however it is worse for performance and still allows starting multiple Iroha instances backed by the same storage, postponing failure for indeterminate time in the future.

### Description of the Change

Added JSON5 support in user-provided configs, such as:

- config and genesis for `iroha`
- config, metadata, signature, instructions for `iroha_client_cli`

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Issue

- #3019 

<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.
More information about this is available in GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword -->

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits

Better human-reading format

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

`json5` crate I use has lack of some functions and features unlike `serde_json`. But it should be enough to interact with user properly.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

You can try running `iroha` or `iroha_client_cli` as always but also you can:
- use `json5` file extension (for default and your own configs)
- use all features of `json5` in your configs (which should not necessarily have `json5` extension), i.e. comments

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->
