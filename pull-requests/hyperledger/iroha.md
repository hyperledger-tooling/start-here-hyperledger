                ## Description

* remove signatures from blocks stored on chain
Signatures are transient and only applicable during consensus. Since blocks in a blockchain are tied together via block hashes, keeping block signatures after consensus is not only superfluous but also creates issues when replaying blocks when topology has changed (related to #4145)
* removed `consensus_estimation` from block header - it was unused
* removed `event_recommendations` from block - it was unused

## Future work
* Following this PR, block sync protocol should be modified to prevent syncing with malicious peers. This can be done with not too much overhead
