### Description of the Change
Add one more iroha2 ordinary image tag to be uploaded to Soramitsu images registry.

### Issue
We redeploy some of k8s deployments based on iroha quite often. Free DockerHub account has images pull limit.

### Benefits

By uploading iroha2 stable & lts images with the same tags as iroha2 has on DockerHub, we will get rid of images pull limit and avoid delays with iroha2 deployments (not only Orillion projects).

### Possible Drawbacks

None.
