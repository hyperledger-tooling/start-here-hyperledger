`data_model` depends on these libraries. Consider this PR a prerequisite for `no_std` support in `data_model`
Manually implemented `Display` trait for `iroha_version::Error` to have it also available in `no_std` context

### Description of the Change

It's important for smartcontracts to be able to access `no_std` functionality. This PR brings:
* remove `std` from `data_model` and it's dependencies `version`, `macro` and `crypto`
* add `std` feature to libraries that require this functionality
* add verification to CI that `data_model` remains `no_std`
