<!-- ### Requirements -->
<!-- * Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- * All new code must have code coverage above 70% (https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-code-coverage). -->
<!-- * CircleCI builds must be passed. -->
<!-- * Critical and blocker issues reported by Sorabot must be fixed. -->
<!-- * Branch must be rebased onto base branch (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/11173889/Rebase+and+merge+guide). -->


### Description of the Change
Ensure that unstable network tests pass for valid code. Previously unstable network tests could fail due to random reshuffling of topology even for the valid code.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->


<!-- Put in the note about what issue is resolved by this PR, especially if it is a GitHub issue. It should be in the form of "Resolves #N" ("Closes", "Fixes" also work), where N is the number of the issue.

<!-- If it is not a GitHub issue but a JIRA issue, just put the link here -->

### Benefits
Tests should indicate code correctness and for correct code should not fail randomly.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Description of the Change
Introduce sending telemetry to substrate-telemetry. There are two messages: the initialization message that indicates the node configuration and the update message that indicates the peers, transactions, blocks.
The telemetry can be configured with the following parameters:
```
"TELEMETRY": {
    "NAME": "Your node's name",
    "URL": "ws://localhost:8001/submit"
}
```
