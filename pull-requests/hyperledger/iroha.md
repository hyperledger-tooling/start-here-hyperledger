                * Now **build** takes **much less time** 🕰, with vcpkg binarycaching and ccache shared between workflow runs and jobs: no need to build vcpkg deps (minus 24..30 mins on every run), ccache hit rate is about 15-20% so it saves up to 6 minutes on each debug build, and about 10 mins on release build.
* After pressing button `Update branch`(i.e. merge base branch into PR head) now triggers `/build before-merge` buildspec, so **will be able to merge after CI passed**. Earlier we have had to push a commit with message `/build ...` (it is still best way to tell CI about it is ready to merge). Try it yourself `.github/chatops-gen-matrix.sh --help`
* **Release** build on MacOS and Ubuntu GCC-10 is **fixed**
* **Docker** images iroha-builder, iroha, iroha-burrow, iroha-ursa are pushed to **ghcr.io** and could be found by link https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pkgs/container/iroha

* slightly reorganize tests - now GTest reports against which database type (postgres or rocks) it is tested.
* buildspec `macos burrow` disabled because it fails on Ry's macos self-hosted runner, and because it is inpoppular and have no reason, except of scientific.

--------------------
Remarks
- chat-ops with comments to PR works restricted - cannot report their statuses to PR. Still in progress because of security reasons and restrictions. There is a way to do, but it is long and hard enough.
  We can trigger CI with message `/build before-merge` in PR comments, and it will build and report status to that comment, but at the moment it cannot report statuses to PR as GitHub Actions do.
- GitHub Actions provide 5GB storage for caches, it would be enough if our caches were incremental, but they are simply tar archives, so they are rotated by GitHub and periodically we build from scratch. ToDo caches with rsync, rclone or restic. Or even better let's rent normal full-time VPS, or install physical server in office.

Hanging when Irohad exits (i.e. during destruction) is not reproducable anymore.

The following tests still need to be fixed:
* 4-integration_add_peer_test(Failed)
* 20-integration_query_permissions_common_test(Failed), 
* 45-regression_regression_test(Failed), 
* 47-system_irohad_test(Failed)

No Timeouts anymore!
