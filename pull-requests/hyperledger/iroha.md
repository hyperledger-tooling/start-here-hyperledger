### Description of the Change
* Refactor of the whole `iroha_config_derive` crate to use the same structures throughout
* Separate traits for `Configurable` / `Configuration`, `LoadFromDisk` and `LoadFromEnv`
* Proxy config generation, but for now the derive is done on the parent struct instead of the proxy. This keeps the change minimal
* `iroha_config_base::derive::Error` refactor
* Fixed doc tests in the `config` crate (and some older ones in `filter`)
* Default derives and the config entrypoint still same as before, will be dealt with in future PRs
