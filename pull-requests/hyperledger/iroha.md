Signed-off-by: i1i1 <vanyarybin1@live.ru>


### Description of the Change

This pr migrates from using clap for parsing cli arguments to structopt crate. Also it introduces simple queries for accounts, assets and domains.

### Benefits

There will be typesafe descriptive structures for cli arguments which remove all boilerplate code. It will also let us easier add new commands to cli and manage existing ones. Apart from that it would be more error prune than our previous implementation.
Also now we are able to query domains, accounts, and assets via cli.
