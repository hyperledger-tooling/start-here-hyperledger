                Hi, Hyperledger community! 
I made a few grammatical edits as I try out the OSS contributions process to your project.

I always enjoy lifecycle processes and think these changes tighten up your message and process while adhering to grammar rules and best practices.

Other technical writers are looking for ways to grow their blockchain skills, so I am pulling together a list of projects they might want to contribute to.
