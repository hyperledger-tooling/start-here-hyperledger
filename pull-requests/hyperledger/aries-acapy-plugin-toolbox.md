                Fixes to work with ACA-Py 0.7.0. A bug in the schema for `ConnRecord` resulted in complications with the official 0.7.0 release so it may be preferable to wait until 0.7.1 is released.

                This PR merges the ongoing work of integration testing for the toolbox plugin. This is not necessarily considered done but the integration tests have stabilized to the point where they are very helpful and we'd like to merge our progress so far and proceed from here for future additions.
