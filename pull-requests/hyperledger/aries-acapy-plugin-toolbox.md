                Prior to this change, running the demo with Alice and Bob resulted in an Indy error: CommonInvalidState for both Alice and Bob that caused both agents to exit. This change updates the Indicio testnet url to use "main" instead of "master," which makes this demo up-to-date with naming conventions and thus resolves the Indy error. #149
