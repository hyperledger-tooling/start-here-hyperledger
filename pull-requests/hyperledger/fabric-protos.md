                The Go publish step is not currently deleting files, which it should
e.g. the now unused .whitelist file in fabric-protos-go

The repos used to publish the Go bindings should not have issue
tracking turned on so adding GitHub settings.yml file to make sure
the correct settings stay in place

Also merged the two Go workflows into one to remove some of the
duplication
