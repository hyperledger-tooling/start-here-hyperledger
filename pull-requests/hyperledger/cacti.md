                If someone sends a pull request that isn't formatted according to the
tools we have in place for auto-format code (ESLint, prettier) then after
this change the CI will fail and this way we don't end up in a situation
where running `yarn lint` on the main branch produces a diff of auto-formatted
code files (which is currently sadly the case).

At the same time as introducing this constraint I'm also applying the automatic
formatting on the code project wide so that the check can actually pass as
intended when this change is getting merged.

                1. Longer term we'll just fix the scripts that are crashing, but right now
as a short term solution I disabled the script execution.
2. It might even be more secure for us to use this ignore scripts flag
permanently because some of the attack vectors are in those scripts which
new versions of the dependencies can execute arbitrary code.

                The detailed explanation is here:

Do not enable auto-merging on GitHub for the pull request doing the release.
The problem with auto-merging here is that it would modify the release commit's SHA as the
rebase would happen on GitHub's servers where your git signing identity is not available to use
given that GitHub does (should) not have access to your private key for signing.
The way the preserve your commit signature as valid the commit SHA must remain the same and the
way to achieve this is to perform the pull request merging with fast forward. The merging
ensures that there is no commit SHA change and the `--ff-only` option ensures that there is no
merge commit to throw a wrench in the process.
