                BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed classes to fix typos in their name: `PluginFactoryPersistanceFabric`
This is being done in this pull request because for some reason (that I still don't understand)
the spell checker started failing on these only in the context of this pull request.
The typos were present on the main branch already somehow having passed spellchecking earlier
and every other time since then.

And also
- prom-clien@15.1.3
- del-cli@5.1.0
- cspell@8.10.4
- del-cli@5.1.0

Quality of life improvements and also hoping to get rid of a few of the
vulnerable dependency versions we have in the codebase according to
dependabot.

More similar changes are coming in with further upgrades but I want to
avoid making bigger changes in one go so that it's easier to hunt down
bugs later if something only gets discovered after we've merged a bunch
of these.

- [x] Have git sign off at the end of commit message to avoid being marked red. You can add `-s` flag when using `git commit` command. You may refer to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for more information.
- [x] Follow the Commit Linting specification. You may refer to this [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification) for more information. 

**Character Limit**
- [x] Pull Request Title and Commit Subject must not exceed 72 characters (including spaces and special characters).
