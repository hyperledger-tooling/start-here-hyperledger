CommitFinalResponse.

                Update from Peter: I needed to do an unsafe cast because that was the least
bad option (other option was to make a breaking change in the quourm 
connector's API).

The issue opened for tracking a proper resolution to this is titled as:
refactor(connector-quorum): make Web3BlockHeader.receiptRoot optional #2555
and the link to it on GitHub is https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/2555

Fixes #2332
