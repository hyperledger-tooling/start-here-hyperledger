- [ ] Have git sign off at the end of commit message to avoid being marked red. You can add `-s` flag when using `git commit` command. You may refer to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for more information.
- [ ] Follow the Commit Linting specification. You may refer to this [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification) for more information. 

**Character Limit**
- [ ] Pull Request Title and Commit Subject must not exceed 72 characters (including spaces and special characters).
