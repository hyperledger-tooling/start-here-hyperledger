                1. The MAINTAINERS.md file was updated with contact details
2. The CODEOWNERS file was updated so that in addition to the current
code owners Rafael also has ownership of some of the sub-direcotires where
he is the most active in terms of contributions.
3. We welcome Rafael to expand the scope of ownership on packages later
as we are always looking to get more help with maintaining the code. :-)

**Pull Request Requirements**
- [x] Rebased onto `upstream/main` branch and squashed into single commit to help maintainers review it more efficient and to avoid spaghetti git commit graphs that obfuscate which commit did exactly what change, when and, why.
- [x] Have git sign off at the end of commit message to avoid being marked red. You can add `-s` flag when using `git commit` command. You may refer to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for more information.
- [x] Follow the Commit Linting specification. You may refer to this [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification) for more information. 

**Character Limit**
- [x] Pull Request Title and Commit Subject must not exceed 72 characters (including spaces and special characters).
- [x] Commit Message per line must not exceed 80 characters (including spaces and special characters).
