                1. Also two more test cases been migrated.
2. A  bug has been fixed in the test tooling package where the keychain vault
container helper class was not passing in the publish all ports configuration
option correctly. This would normally deserve it's own commit but this bug
has been caught in other similar classes at least 3 times in the recent weeks
so it's not really worth the attention anymore so I'll just include it in
this commit so that we save some time on reviewer attention and CI resource
usage.

                1. Also turned off tape test execution completely for the package in ci.yaml
This would've been a no-op anyway just wasting resources since we have no
tests left that need tape at all.

                The process for this fix was to:
1. `yarn why -R dicer`
2. Then examine the output of that and see which dependencies are using
dicer indirectly (transient dependencies)
3. `yarn up multer --exact`
4. `yarn up express-openapi-validator --exact`
5. Profit, e.g. running `yarn why -R dicer` at this point shows that
dicer has been eliminated from the dependency tree completely.

                1. Currently our integration tests depend on pre-published container
images to be on the official registry (ghcr.io). This has pros and cons.
The pro is that we can pin the tests to a specific ledger version and
then have confidence that the test code works with that specific image.
On the other hand if the image itself has problems we won't know it until
after it was published and then tests were executed with it (unless we
perform manual testing which is a lot of effrot as it requires the
manual modification of the test cases).
2. In order to gives us the ability to test against the container image
definitions as they are in the current revision of the source code,
we are adding here a couple of utility functions to streamline writing
test cases that build the container images for themselves as part of the
test case.

An example of how to use it in a test case:

```typescript
const imgConnectorJvm = await buildImageConnectorCordaServer({
    logLevel,
});

// ...

connector = new CordaConnectorContainer({
    logLevel,
    imageName: imgConnectorJvm.imageName,
    imageVersion: imgConnectorJvm.imageVersion,
    envVars: [envVarSpringAppJson],
});

```

                1. The polkadot libraries are all ESM-only so we have to import them
in a specific way in order to avoid runtime crashes.
2. This was not done in the original implementation of the polkadot
connector and because of that all the tests were failing.
3. Refactoring the code so that all polkadot related dependencies are
imported dynamically fixes the issue.
4. Also fixed the issue where the getRawTransaction HTTP REST handler
was not `await` ing for the result of the connector's method which broke
the run-transaction test case (now also fixed)

Fixes #3077

                1. The hostconfig portion of the container start configuration was not
being set up correctly which made it so that the exposed ports were not
published on randomized ports like they were supposed to.
2. This caused  the `fabric-v2-2-x/run-transaction-with-ws-ids.test.ts`
test to fail because it couldn't map the container port to a host machine
port.
3. Setting up the ws-test-server.ts class so that it does map the ports
to the host machine solved the issue.

                The system chaincode query method's returns were not decoded correctly
because the test request assembling code was not updated to call the
responseType as such (old name was type)
