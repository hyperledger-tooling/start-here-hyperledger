                1. The old way to use docker compose was through the standalone binary
`docker-compose`
2. This was working for a while but now the auto-upgrades that we cannot
seem to avoid have caught up with us and broke ci.sh in the GitHub action
runners because the standalone binary is no longer available at all and
therefore the migration must happen.
3. Point 2 is just a theory but one that is considered to be very likely
correct.
4. It is to be seen if we'll have any other downstream issues such as the
tests failing in other ways due to this underlying docker change.

                1. When we removed the RustC compiler class and the backing container,
we also deleted the test cases referencing that code, but we forgot to
remove the test case inclusion from the TAP config.

                1. Prior to this change the polling function that waits for transactions
to be confirmed was running in  while loop without any delay, meaning that
the code that fetches the latest block is executing thousands of times
each second (or however fast the CPU in the machine/network connection are).
2. Now there is a second delay between each execution of the loop so that
we are not hammering the node of the ledger we are connected to.
3. This also has the added benefit of the test cases using this method
using much less CPU power.

                1. The older versions of the AIO image are rusty (flaky to boot) and so
to increase the stability of the example application I considered it
prudent to upgrade to the latest and greatest (non-breaking) all-in-one
image that we have.
2. There might be other branches out there in development where the same
change is already pending, if this is the case then apologies, but I just
had to get this done right away because it had a direct dependency from
another pull request where I was upgrading web3 packages and I had to
have the example application up and running in order to verify that other
pull requests not messing anything up, so here we are.
