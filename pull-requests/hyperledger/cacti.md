                The Weaver Fabric interoperation-node-sdk used the "aes-128-ctr" algorithm in a hardcoded manner for asymmetric encryption/decryption. 128-bit AES, though secure for classical computing, is quantum-unsafe.
So an option is added to use "aes-256-ctr" on demand.
The "aes-128-ctr" algorithm is still supported because many signing keys, typically those used in the Fabric testnets, have embedded elliptic curve parameters with key length 16 bytes, and those still need to be supported.
