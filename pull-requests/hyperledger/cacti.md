                - Add a bash script in tools to build all the weaver packages in single command.
- Export `getMSPConfigurations` from fabric interop sdk (is imported in fabric cli, was causing compilation error on node 20)
- Move bash shebang to the top of `check-nodes-status`. On ubuntu 20 having this below was causing the file to be interpreted as sh (resulting in error)
- Update `package-local.json` files to be more inline with `package.json`.
