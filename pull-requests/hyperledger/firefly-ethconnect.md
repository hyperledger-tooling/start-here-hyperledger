                See #198 for the ðŸ¤• behavior you can get if we don't protect against this.

The logic here has an implicit assumption of this rule, so that when we read a page it's never going to extend past the `blockNumber` of the header of the chain at the point we query.

Otherwise, we think:
- Gap to head 1234 is > 250 - so we're in catchup
- Read 5000 (page size) - cool we've read 5000 blocks ... but actually there were only 1234 to read!!!
- ok, now we're not in catchup any more - start reading from where we left off - but that's now skipped a whole bunch of blocks.
