                Noticed in a K8s environment when testing https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-helm-charts/pull/12 that ethconnect was very slow to shut down. Likely bc its not receiving the sigterm: https://hynek.me/articles/docker-signals/

                When trying to have Ethconnect connect to a remote Geth node secured via HTTPS we noticed we were getting invalid cert errors:
```
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

In the process of testing to confirm this fixes this issue.
