#### Type of change
- Bug fix

#### Description
Since RAFT node is able to run with capability turned on, changed the gateway code to evaluate consensus type rather than evaluating channel capabilities.
Following that changed the [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/internal/pkg/gateway/submit.go#L53](url) file to check the consensus type.

- Documentation update

#### Description

Since v3.0.0-preview users will be expected to be very interested in trying out the BFT ordering service,
I think it would be beneficial for the users to easily try its end-to-end operation, like other features (CouchDB, CCaaS, etc.).

This patch updates test_network.md:
- To update the network.sh help text output
- Add brief instructions for running a test network with BFT ordering service

                #### Type of change
- New feature

#### Description
 BFT Block Puller: a common block verifier to the peer the orderer.

The new implementation verifies the integrity and signatures of a block stream, while keeping a copy of the latest configuration.

Every time a config block arrives, it must first be verified using VerifyBlock and then used as an argument to the UpdateConfig method.  

The block stream could be composed of either:

- full blocks, which are verified using the VerifyBlock method, or
- block attestations (a header+metadata, with nil data) which are verified using the VerifyBlockAttestation method.

In both cases, config blocks must arrive in full.

This commit also moved `BlockVerifierAssembler` form `orderer/common/cluster/util.go` to `common/deliverclient/verifier_assembler.go`, as it is now used by both orderer and peer. In addition, `VerificationRegistry` was removed from  `orderer/common/cluster/util.go`  as it is no longer in use.

#### Type of change

- Bug fix

#### Description

In internal/pkg/peer/blocksprovider/deliverer.go:150

Local variable `totalDuration` measures the total sleep during retries. If it exceeds `reconnectTotalTimeThreshold` the Deliverer may exit if `MaxRetryDurationExceededHandler` returns true. 

However, it does not reset on success (block reception), so `DeliverBlocks()` may exit eventually if the cumulative sleep time is large, but no consecutive reconnect failure sequence exceeds the threshold for stopping retries.

The solution is to reset `totalDuration` together when we reset `failureCounter`.

                This PR updates add_orderer.md to improve it from the user's perspective.

#### Type of change
- Documentation update

#### Description
I'm trying out the BFT samples in fabric-samples recently.
As part of this process, I also tried to add an orderer following the instructions in the doc added by https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/4390.

I've identified some areas from a user's perspective that might benefit from further improvements.
This PR updates add_orderer.md for the above improvements.

#### Other possible improvements, or points that were not clear after trying the procedure

- I interpreted that [such a file path description](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/17b77cf1d8750263df89316cd0c888f18b872022/docs/source/create_channel/add_orderer.md?plain=1#L185) in Add the fifth orderer to the config should actually be filled in with the result of base64 encoding of the certificate in the file, but some readers may overlook it.
  - It may be less misleading to explicitly state in a snippet, such as `<The result of base64 encoding of the contents in ...>`.

- It might be more user-friendly if the command snippets for entering `cli` container and copying between cli and local were also illustrated in the doc.
