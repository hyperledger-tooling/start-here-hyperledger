                While I was working on #3534 I realized that the master branch has also a potential issue with PropagateEnvorinment field.
A different implementation/version of the unmarshaller might set `builder.PropagateEnvironment` to nil or empty slice. In the last case PropagateEnvironment won't have a correct value. The fix is to use a bulletproof check `builder.PropagateEnvironment == nil` => `len(builder.PropagateEnvironment) == 0`

                This is a backport of pull request https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2643

Because we can't upgrade viper to `v1.1.1` in which the bug of shadowing a key is fixed and hooks are introduced, I had to find a workaround to simplify the backport as more as possible. 

Also, I added a test and a short explanation for overriding the list of system chaincodes. The default approach with env var `CORE_CHAINCODE_SYSTEM_XXX: enabled` won't work due to a bug in viper in earlier versions. I agree that bumping it to v1.1.1 requires too many changes and might break the LTS release. 

updated a few related tests to use strings as viper config values instead of variables.
