                #### Type of change

- Improvement to code

#### Description

If "/fabric/sampleconfig" is used to create a network

in "core.yaml"

```
operations:
# host and port for the operations server
listenAddress: 127.0.0.1:9443
```

in "orderer.yaml"

```
Admin:
# host and port for the admin server
ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1:9443
```

The port in both addresses is the same which is causing

Error: failed to initialize operations subsystem: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:9443: bind: address already in use

Happened while following [Running chaincode in development mode" Tutorial"](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peer-chaincode-devmode.html)

So, changing the address in the core.yaml solves the problem and it is not overlapping with any other config.

#### Additional details

Tested `127.0.0.1:9444` not colliding with any other config
