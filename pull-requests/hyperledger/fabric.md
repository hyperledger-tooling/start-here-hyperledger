                Last LTS version **[release-1.4](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/tree/release-1.4)** of **hyperledger-fabric-ca** was abandoned 4 years ago, but the successor version **1.5** has never been present as a candidate in the [public docs page](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Instead, the hyperledger-fabric-ca team only update **latest** version.

#### Type of change

- Documentation update

#### Description
To adapt **hyperledger-fabric-ca** docs version, rename all references to hyperledger-fabric-ca version **release-1.4** (if present) to **latest**, namely, change https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4 to https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest. Because **hyperledger-fabric-ca** docs version **release-1.4** hasn't been updated for 4 years, and the public maintaining version is **latest**.

#### Additional details

Updated docs is built out for review: https://ethan-li-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
