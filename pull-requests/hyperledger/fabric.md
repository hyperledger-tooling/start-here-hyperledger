This PR
- Makes the read of private key via hashed-index from the private data store, prior to adding the purge-marker, so as to avoid the race condition, where the hashed-index entries could be deleted via the background process, before they are read in the commit path.

- Deletes the purged key from statedb even when the private key is overwritten by a succeeding transaction in the block, and the corresponding private data is missing

#### Type of change
- Bug fix
