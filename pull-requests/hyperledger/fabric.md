                While I was working on #3534 I realized that the master branch has also a potential issue with PropagateEnvorinment field.
A different implementation/version of the unmarshaller might set `builder.PropagateEnvironment` to nil or empty slice. In the last case PropagateEnvironment won't have a correct value. The fix is to use a bulletproof check `builder.PropagateEnvironment == nil` => `len(builder.PropagateEnvironment) == 0`
