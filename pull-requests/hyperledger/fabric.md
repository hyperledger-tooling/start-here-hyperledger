                #### Type of change

- New feature

#### Description

Due to some considering NIST curves insecure and
Golang having ed25519 native support, there was
not a reason for not implementing in Fabric.

Tests cases for ed25519 were also added. Since
ed25519 key derivation is not called by any
function, I left as a TODO.

As I am working on ed25519 support for node fabric-gateway,
I needed to add ed25519 support for cryptogen also,
aiming to pass tests with certificates containing
ed25519 keys. Since the node fabric-gateway tests
generate their crypto material with cryptogen, I
adapted cryptogen to support ed25519 keys.

#### Additional details

Some tests concerning ed25519 key generation and certificate parsing
were added.

#### Related issues

<!--- Include a link to any associated issues, e.g. Jira issue or approved rfc. -->

<!---
#### Release Note
If change impacts current users, uncomment Release Note heading and provide
release note text.
Also, copy release note text into the release specific /release_notes file.
