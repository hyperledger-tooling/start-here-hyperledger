                MVCC invalidations generated a log warning but did not
indicate which versions are mismatched.
This change adds a log warning indicating the specific
version mismatch to help users troubleshoot MVCC invalidations.

Also the version formatting in the log was updated from format:

   &version.Height{BlockNum:0x6, TxNum:0x0}

to user friendly format:

   {BlockNum: 6, TxNum: 0}

Also, added a small expectation to a test for `chaincode.system` configuration
