                Yoav has been a significant contributor to Fabric core's ordering service. 

He designed and implemented the system channel removal feature which is one of the two main features in Fabric v2.3.

He also took part in the implementation of the SmartBFT consensus library (https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/consensus/) which is now being introduced as the first BFT consensus of Fabric. 

Currently, he plays an important role in the re-architecture of the ordering service for Fabric v3.0 which includes:

- Removing the support for Kafka 
- Removing the system channel from the ordering service
- Inverting the control between the Fabric consensus and the dependencies. 

Additionally, he participates in code reviews of pull requests with high risk potential such as: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/3863 and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/3651

Lastly, he is among the top contributors of code in the last several months.

I therefore nominate Yoav as a maintainer of Fabric core.

                The Gateway has retry logic for failing ordering nodes, however if an ordering node doesn’t respond, then the Submit call will timeout without allowing other ordering nodes to be tried. This commit implements a BroadcastTimeout that allows individual OSN’s to timeout before the overall Submit timeout expires. Similar logic already exists for calls to endorser peers.

                The peer local config allows the endpoint addresses and TLS root certs or ordering nodes to be overridden. The gateway should apply these overrides when connecting to orderer nodes for transaction submit.
