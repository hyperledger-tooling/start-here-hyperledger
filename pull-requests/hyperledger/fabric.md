                Unsanitized input from a CLI argument flows into io.ioutil.ReadFile, where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to read arbitrary files.

                    * Bug fix

While the new peer gateway service tries to extract channel and chaincode information from the signed proposal, it doesn't check the proposal fields for validity. Therefore malformed proposal might end up crashing peer service. This commit adds validation to the parameters extracted from the proposal.

                In the old ginkgo, the timeout by default is 24h

In the new ginkgo (v2) the timeout by default is 1h

1 hour is not enough to pass the integration tests

I suggest that you explicitly pass the timeout parameter equal to 24h, so that there is enough time to pass the integration tests
