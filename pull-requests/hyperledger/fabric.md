<h2>v2.32.0</h2>
<h2>2.32.0 (2024-05-20)</h2>
<h2>üêç PYCON US 2024 EDITION üêç</h2>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where setting <code>verify=False</code> on the first request from a
Session will cause subsequent requests to the <em>same origin</em> to also ignore
cert verification, regardless of the value of <code>verify</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56">https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>verify=True</code> now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6667">#6667</a>)</li>
<li>Requests now supports optional use of character detection
(<code>chardet</code> or <code>charset_normalizer</code>) when repackaged or vendored.
This enables <code>pip</code> and other projects to minimize their vendoring
surface area. The <code>Response.text()</code> and <code>apparent_encoding</code> APIs
will default to <code>utf-8</code> if neither library is present. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6702">#6702</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
calculated in the request content-length. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6589">#6589</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6629">#6629</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed bug where an extra leading <code>/</code> (path separator) could lead
urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6644">#6644</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6503">#6503</a>)</li>
<li>Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6641">#6641</a>)</li>

#### Type of change

- Improvement (improvement to code, performance, etc)

#### Description

I was trying to upgrade the chaincode version from v2.2 to v2.5.4 so I went to the documentation and tried to do the steps mentioned in the documentation. When I tried with those commands I faced different errors. The errors I encountered are couldn't run the orderer container as the orderer was looking for certificates which was not backed up. The opt path in the docker container has no files in it. Instead we have to backup from var directory which includes both the orderer and production folders. In  the peer container we have to mention the name of the fabric network for the chaincode container to start otherwise the chaincode container is not starting. So I fixed all the errors and made a new documentation for upgrading the fabric components and upgrading the capabilities.

#### Additional details
Added upgrading steps for couchdb and fabric-ca also.

                The following changes have been made:
- added new possible error based on platform and Go release
- changed the work with [encoding/json](https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/) - https://go.dev/doc/go1.22#minor_library_changes. 
`Marshaling and encoding functionality now escapes '\b' and '\f' characters as \b and \f instead of \u0008 and \u000c`.
- The creators of go overmuch with the change of cover work. So far I have turned on the old flag of cover operation - `GOEXPERIMENT=nocoverageredesign`. I will open a question in the go community. Most likely in the next release of go it will be necessary to remove this flag - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/67427.

                #### Type of change

- New feature

#### Description

BadgerDB was added as alternative for GolevelDB state database.
Choosing the better alternative for the GolevelDB was a goal of my research within the paper *"A Journey Towards the Most Efficient State Database For Hyperledger Fabric"*: 

  * [Short version](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174970)
  * [Detailed version](https://www.oajaiml.com/uploads/archivepdf/36321188.pdf)

This PR adds Badger because it showed better performance results in comparison with GolevelDB, Bbolt and RocksDB. 

PR satisfies [potential future items of the current Hyperledger Fabric Roadmap](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Hyperledger+Fabric+Roadmap#:~:text=Replace%20GolevelDB%20with%20faster%20database) where the goal to replace the GolevelDB with faster database is mentioned.
 

#### Additional details

Detailed Hyperledger Fabric performance reports mentioned in the papers above are availiable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/102_Kgpxsjcog5RNcXPo8MK1dvVYoGODp?usp=sharing). They were made using Hyperledger Caliper tool. The tool was used to measure main performance metrics on HLF peer with default GolevelDB and integrated Badger, Bbolt and RocksDB. More measuring details are described in the aforementioned studies.

To demonstrate Badger's potential advantage over GolevelDB, go benchmarks were added to the packages leveldbhelper and badgerdbhelper respectively. The results measured locally show that Badger has better performance for "*put*" operations than GolevelDB. The output is:
