                #### Type of change

- Improvement to code

#### Description

If "/fabric/sampleconfig" is used to create a network

in "core.yaml"

```
operations:
# host and port for the operations server
listenAddress: 127.0.0.1:9443
```

in "orderer.yaml"

```
Admin:
# host and port for the admin server
ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1:9443
```

The port in both addresses is the same which is causing

Error: failed to initialize operations subsystem: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:9443: bind: address already in use

Happened while following [Running chaincode in development mode" Tutorial"](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peer-chaincode-devmode.html)

So, changing the address in the core.yaml solves the problem and it is not overlapping with any other config.

#### Additional details

Tested `127.0.0.1:9444` not colliding with any other config

                #### Type of change

- Bug fix

#### Description

Bug happens when the endorsement policy is set to k-out-of-n where (n - k) > 1.
For example, when there are 6 organizations and the endorsement policy is set
to majority (i.e. 4-out-of-6). The combinations calculated by chooseKoutOfN()
in original code are as below.
	[0 1 2 5], [0 1 2 5], [0 1 2 5], [0 1 3 5],
	[0 1 3 5], [0 1 4 5], [0 2 3 5], [0 2 3 5],
	[0 2 4 5], [0 3 4 5], [1 2 3 5], [1 2 3 5],
	[1 2 4 5], [1 3 4 5], [2 3 4 5]

Obviously, the function fails to find out all the possible combinations. Some of
 the combinations are overrided by child's call. This bug would trigger below
error sometimes when the alive peers are not within the above combinations.

	[discovery] chaincodeQuery -> ERRO 13a Failed constructing descriptor for
	chaincode chaincodes:<name:"XXXX" > ,: no peer combination can satisfy the
	endorsement policy

To fix it, the last line of choose() should be changed to pass a copy of
"currentSubGroup" to the recursive call instead, i.e.

	choose(n, targetAmount, i+1, append(make([]int, 0), currentSubGroup...), subGroups)

After applying the fix, the resulting combinations generated should be corrected
as below.
	[0 1 2 3], [0 1 2 4], [0 1 2 5], [0 1 3 4],
	[0 1 3 5], [0 1 4 5], [0 2 3 4], [0 2 3 5],
	[0 2 4 5], [0 3 4 5], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 5],
	[1 2 4 5], [1 3 4 5], [2 3 4 5]
