Split some code into separate files. Particularly the gRPC service method implementation and tests were unreasonably large, making the codebase difficult to navigate and extend. Code that was previously in api.go is now located in: chaincodeevents.go, commitstatus.go, diff.go, endorse.go, evaluate.go, and submit.go. Unit tests specific to these functions are split out of api_test.go into corresponding _test.go files.

Simplification of the way chaincode events unit tests define the local peer ledger height. Previously a postSetup function for specific tests reconfigured the ledger mocks. Now only a localLedgerHeight property is specified in the test definition.

                Note that client_golang v1.11.1 attempts pull in protobuf v1.4.3.
However, protobuf v1.4.3 is incompatible with raft in v2.2.x.
Therefore, need to add a "replace" in go.mod to keep protobuf at v1.3.3.

The update also pulls in github.com/go-kit/kit v0.9.0, which requires one code update.

                Split some code into separate files. Particularly the gRPC service method implementation and tests were unreasonably large, making the codebase difficult to navigate and extend. Code that was previously in api.go is now located in: chaincodeevents.go, commitstatus.go, diff.go, endorse.go, evaluate.go, and submit.go. Unit tests specific to these functions are split out of api_test.go into corresponding _test.go files.

Simplification of the way chaincode events unit tests define the local peer ledger height. Previously a postSetup function for specific tests reconfigured the ledger mocks. Now only a localLedgerHeight property is specified in the test definition.

                Discovery ledger heights can be slightly behind the actual peer ledger height. Ensure the most up-to-date information is used for the local peer by querying the ledger height directly. This avoids the possibility of a remote peer with a lower ledger height being selected as an endorser.

Refactored Gateway service method implementations and associated tests into separate files as the size of the api files were getting unmanageable.

                Probably best to provide updates piecemeal for commentary or change of direction etc. - done up until the start of "Orderer considerations" section. 

- Can "runaway situations" be described more precisely, formally.. 
- We use "you" a lot so let's ensure that we always mean the same or similar role / authorization for the action. 
- To be continued with a subsequent PR.

                    ledgerutil: Add "verify" command

                #### Type of change

- New feature

#### Description

We would like to propose a new command in Ledger Utility that checks the integrity of a single ledger. The existing commands in Ledger Utility aim at checking the ledger when any difference is found by comparing two ledgers. The purpose of the command proposed is to complement these commands by finding any defect in ledger files in a single peer that could be caused by potential software bugs or disk errors.

This patch adds a new command, “verify,” to Ledger Utility, which performs integrity checks for a specified ledger. Currently, the checks for the hash values in the headers of the blocks are implemented.

A use case assumed is to run the command locally in a peer periodically, which can be utilized as one of the health checks for the peer.

#### Additional details

This patch contains a sample ledger that is tweaked to have a hash value error (the hash value for Block 0 is modified not to match the block payload). Using the ledger, the command proposed can detect the error as follows:

```
$ ./build/bin/ledgerutil verify ./internal/ledgerutil/testdata/sample_bad_ledger -o /tmp/ledgerutil-verify-result-bad
...
Successfully executed verify tool. Some error(s) are found.
$ cat /tmp/ledgerutil-verify-result-bad/mychannel_verification_result/blocks.json
[
{"number":0,"valid":false,"errors":["DataHash mismatch"]}
,
{"number":1,"valid":false,"errors":["PreviousHash mismatch"]}
]
```
