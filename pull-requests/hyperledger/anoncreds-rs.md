                Updating version to 0.2.1 after #327. Only for the JS wrapper, as I understand we follow the same strategy as in Askar and Indy VDR. I think @TimoGlastra in #296 did already the set-up so it will be just a matter of running the workflow manually.

                In making this PR, I looked up the latest versions of each of the called out in the Snyk report and used that.  We'll see how that goes.
