                Adding the missing methods from react-native wrappers and making lots of minor fixes, mostly related to typos and outdated variable/method names.

At the moment working for a full issuance / proof flow without revocation. However there is a memory leak leading to custom app crashes and variable corruption (!) when creating presentation, at least happening in Android. Hopefully this is related to the fix done in #129 (I didn't tested with it yet).

PS: All getXXXFromJson methods can be heavily refactored as they do almost the same thing. For the moment just wanted to be conservative to be focused in solving all issues, but any suggestion to make it cleaner will be appreciated!

                    refactor(js)!: use JSON objects in API instead of strings and instances

                This is an attempt (without doing anything revolutionary) to make JS API a bit more simple to use, avoiding the so-many conversions from JSON to string  that we found during integration with AFJ. 

For most methods that are currently receiving `AnoncredsObject` instances, now we accept also passing JSON objects. This makes the caller to not care about object instantiation and clearing handles, which is done internally. Hopefully, in a normal flow the caller will need only to care about freeing a few objects (like Credentials).

I'm not sure if I'm using the `try-finally` method correctly (I'm particularly worried about the order of execution of finally if an exception is thrown) so any comments on this approach would be appreciated. I wanted to make this process of "checking object type and loading from JSON/add to handles to clear array" more elegant, but I think I'll need some more TypeScript lessons from @TimoGlastra and @blu3beri before attempting to do that ðŸ˜› .

Some tests were added to this repo, but I didn't check this as a patch of AFJ to see how is it going, something I'd like to do before merging. 

Summary of changes: 

- Refactor `load` in AnonCredsObjects to `fromJson`, loading from a JSON object rather than a string
- Refactor `toJson` in AnoncredsObject to return a JSON object rather than a string
- All constructors and methods in API AnoncredsObjects accept both AnonCredsObjects and JSON objects. This is the most tricky part: for every passed JSON object, an  ephemeral AnonCredsObject instance will be created and must be cleared before returning to the caller
- Add some missing fromJson (like the one from Credential)
- Rename keyProof -> keyCorrectnessProof to match the naming of other fields

                This PR refines type hints in the python wrapper. These corrections make static type checkers like pyright/pylance happier.

I'll open this as a draft for now and add more commits as I run into type complaints from pyright.
