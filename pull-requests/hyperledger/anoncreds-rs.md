                This PR updates the MAINTAINERS.md file to follow the outline from the [Besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) repo. 

I added the current AnonCreds maintainers as active maintainers (@WadeBarnes, @andrewwhitehead, @swcurran, @TimoGlastra).

In addition I added two new maintainers that will start working on the implementation and reviews:
- Darko Kulic (@dkulic) from SICPA will start with the changes to the AnonCreds library (as described in the board): https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/16. Adding him a maintainers makes sure he can manage issues, add new items to the project board and merge pull request.
- Berend Sliedrecht (@blu3beri) from Animo will not start contributing right away but will be mostly involved in PR reviews and merging PRs for now. Adding him as a maintainer makes sure he can review and merge PRs, and manage issues in the repos.

To finalize this:
- @blu3beri, @dkulic if you want to be added as a maintainer please reply in this PR that you are willing to become a maintainer of this project
- @WadeBarnes, @andrewwhitehead, @swcurran, @TimoGlastra if you agree with the changes from this PR please approve this PR. If you don't agree please let us know why and how to change it. Once we have three approvals (one of which is mine, so two to go) and no vetos we can go ahead and merge and add the new maintainers. 
- @dkulic, @andrewwhitehead, @swcurran, @WadeBarnes could you share your LFID so it can be added to the maintainers file
