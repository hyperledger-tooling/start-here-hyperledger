                This PR adds a new playground for FPC Chaincode. We introduce a "single command" which deploys a local "for-testing-only-purpose" Fabric Network and installs a FPC chaincode, including all lifecycle interactions. The goal is to provide an easy and quick way to play with your FPC chaincode without becoming an expert of deploying a test network. To implement this new playground, we use FSC to specify and run a Fabric network,

A readme walks the through the process of setting up the network and interact with the FPC chaincode using our simple-cli app.
