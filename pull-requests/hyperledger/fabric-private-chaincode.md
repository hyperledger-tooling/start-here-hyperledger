                This PR contributes major components of the demo, which function as expected -- except that the worker runs in a non-graphenized python server.

Notably, the PR also contributes an end-to-end orchestration of the demo (see `orchestrate.sh` under `irb`), which exercises all the components (locally), up to the diagnosis and report of results.
