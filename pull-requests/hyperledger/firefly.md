                Closes #713, useful for parsing logs w/ `jq` or searching through logs using log aggregators like Filebeat + OpenSearch

Using a slightly modified config from a default `dev` stack:
```yaml
log:
  level: debug
  reportCaller: true
  json:
    enabled: true
```

and running the image locally:

```shell
make docker
docker run -v ${HOME}/.firefly/stacks/dev/init/config/:/etc/firefly -it hyperledger/firefly -f /etc/firefly/firefly_core_0.yml
```

results in:

```json

This does not give any way to set `decimals` from FireFly when creating a pool, and it does not change the formatting of any values exposed on the FireFly API (ie for token balances). It simply accepts `decimals` if it is provided by a token connector upon pool creation, stores it, and returns it when querying token pools.

                We recently merged a change in how blockchain accounts are created for the E2E tests. This worked fine for a normal run. The nightly integration test also stops all the services, starts them up again, and re-runs all the tests. This meant that there weren't enough "extra" test blockchain accounts allocated for the second test run after the restart. This PR fixes that.

                Every blockchain event will have a blockchain TX ID (such as an Ethereum
transaction hash), whether or not it has a FireFly transaction. This is
useful to record as another indexed field on the table.

It will also allow manually correlating blockchain events to FireFly transactions
in the case that the blockchain doesn't pass through enough data to do the
correlation based on FireFly IDs (such as custom smart contracts, ERC20 transfers
without a "data" argument, etc).

Summary of the changes:
* The `confirm` parameter for `/invoke` will now be honored (previously it was ignored)
* The `fftypes.ContractCallResponse` type is removed, and `/invoke` requests now just return `fftypes.Operation`
* Two new event types are added - `EventTypeBlockchainInvokeOpSucceeded` and `EventTypeBlockchainInvokeOpFailed` - which reference an operation ID (open to thoughts on whether `topic` and `correlator` should be filled in)

We cannot assure that the identity verification for an identity, will be processed by the aggregator before messages sent by that identity, or child identities registered under that identity. Because they are all sent on different topics.
