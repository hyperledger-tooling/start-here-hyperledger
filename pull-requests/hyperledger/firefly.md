                When trying to investigate https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/runs/6001824099?check_suite_focus=true I found that I didn't have the container logs.

Looks like it's due to a clash in the names between the token tests

                This PR includes only testing changes, which are necessary for the upcoming `v0.0.47` release of the FireFly CLI.

It moves the responsibility for blockchain account creation to the CLI, and uses the new `stackState.json` file generated by the CLI to get a list of available accounts that can be used in tests.

This PR also enables the identity E2E tests for Fabric and Besu based FireFly stacks.

                This includes the commit from #693.

Add helper URLs:

```
GET /apis/{apiName}/listeners/{eventPath} - list all listeners matching this event on this API
POST /apis/{apiName}/listeners/{eventPath} - create a new listener for this event on this API
```

Also makes `topic` a required field for contract listeners, and enforces uniqueness of listeners across these 2 dimensions:
* namespace + name
* topic + contract location + event signature

Violating either uniqueness constraint when attempting to create a listener will result in HTTP 409, so applications can rely on this behavior to perform "create this listener if it does not already exist". Note that `name` is still optional, and a unique one will be assigned at creation time if none is specified.

                The main thing this PR adds is completed descriptions for all configuration options. It also adds a new `ffc()` for FireFly Configuration message keys for translations. The configuration key requires that a `fieldType` be set as another parameter in addition to the configuration description. The `fieldType` is a `string` that describes the Go type that FireFly Core will parse the field as.

                This PR fixes a regression that was introduced recently into PostgreSQL migrations. The issue first occurred when the `payload_ref` column was removed in this commit: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/commit/7b02d90d85c1632b65c11f73667a1f35f9f5ac20#diff-aace6955c9ca1493ae6a4a7f8bb03aa93f8d12ea4ca6f4b7ee74321bc875d379L12. 

A later postgres migration (number `21`) referenced this column but it was no longer, so it failed to migrate the database with the following message:

```
Error: FF10163: Database migration failed: FF10163: Database migration failed: 2 errors occurred:
	* migration failed: column "payload_ref" does not exist (column 70) in line 8: BEGIN;

ALTER TABLE data DROP COLUMN blobstore;
ALTER TABLE data ADD blob_hash CHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE data ADD blob_public VARCHAR(1024);

-- Make payload_ref larger and a varchar, to accomodate more flexible IDs for non-IPFS shared storage plugins
ALTER TABLE batches ALTER COLUMN payload_ref TYPE VARCHAR(256) USING payload_ref;

CREATE INDEX data_blobs ON data(blob_hash);

COMMIT;
 (details: pq: column "payload_ref" does not exist)
	* pq: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block in line 0: SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1)
```

A misguided attempt to fix this issue was merged in https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/pull/683. That PR removed postgres migrations `20` and `21` in an attempt to match the sqlite migrations. However, that "fix" did not work.

This PR undoes https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/pull/683 by adding `20` and `21` back again. It also fixes the original problem, by not attempting to alter the column in `21` that no longer exists.

This PR also adds postgres to the test matrix for PR approval which should prevent us from winding up in this situation again.

                The logging, retry and other configuration features we have in the FireFly wrapper on resty, should be available to other microservices. That way we can have consistency in how you configure it and the features you get.

                Previously, contract listeners could be added in 3 ways:
1. By passing a full event definition inline
2. By passing a partial event definition (containing just an event name) along with an interface reference
3. By passing an event ID

Number (2) is slightly confusing in how it is expressed and differentiated from (1), and also has been slightly broken since we don't actually support event lookup by "name" (rather it's by "pathname", and "pathname" isn't a field available on the FFIEventDefinition type).

To clean all this up, I'm proposing here that we drop the existing (2) and (3) and instead end up with only these two ways to add a listener:
1. By passing a full event definition inline
2. By passing an interface reference and event pathname

Technically there's no reason to drop the lookup by event ID, so if there is a strong argument to keep it, we can. But I like the simplicity of these two codepaths that I anticipate will be the most common.

                It looks like at some point we removed sqlite migrations 20 and 21, but did not remove the corresponding postgres migrations. This was causing FireFly to fail to start when attempting to apply postgres migrations. This PR aligns the postgres migrations with the working sqlite migrations.

                A bunch of changes to improve our config docs (thanks @nguyer for your work there), and some structural changes to the `config` and `i18n` packages to allow them to be used by other microservices building in Go within the FireFly project.

- `pkg/config` - moved out the package for configuration, including the facility for Markdown generation
  - Split out the configuration that is base (just `log` and `lang`) from the Core configuration
  - `internal/coreconfig` contains the core configuration
  - Note that `coreconfig.Reset()` initializes all the defaults in a lock (needed to avoid concurrent map errors)
- `pkg/i18n` - moved out the translation framework
  - All the framework for translation moved
  - Tweak to how the default `en` translations are initialized, to allow sub-modules to keep adding keys
  - Split out `ErrorMessageKey` from `MessageKey` - with the distinction that errors have to have a registered prefix, that means microservices will not re-use message codes from other microservices
  - `FF10` errors are the FireFly Core errors
  - `FF00` errors are raised from the common utilities in `pkg` - note this mean renames of some codes
  - `FF201` errors are for the new Transaction Manager microservice being split out of EthConnect (the reason for doing this work now)

                I was diagnosing a message stuck in `Pending` state on the latest mainline code, even though the logs and state all showed it had been confirmed. It was an identity claim broadcast.

I found this log entry, which was from the batch persist logic running _concurrently_ with the aggregator:

```
[2022-04-07T02:34:35.666Z] DEBUG ...firefly: Batch data insert optimization failed for batch '21319666-b115-491c-af29-48da417904db': FF10116: Database insert failed: FF10375: Failed to retrieve sequence for insert row 1 (could mean duplicate insert) dbtx=3pRrPKf3 role=event-manager
```

I believe the problem is we're updating the cache before the DB commit at the moment when persisting the batch, so what was happening was the aggregator was confirming it with an `UPDATE messages SET ...` statement, but that was happening _before_ the messages were being upserted.

                The policy engine described in https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ethconnect/issues/149#issuecomment-920866244 is starting to come together, with some evolved architecture.

The intention is for this to be a separate microservice, so it can be pluggable with different implementations easily, have a separate scaling model, and be closer to EthConnect in where it sits in the architecture than to the core.

However, the source of truth for the completion of operations is still FireFly. So this is more like an augmented _component_ of FireFly, than it is a plugin/connector that performs a particular task on behalf of FireFly. So as such I believe it should connect _in_ to FireFly to perform actions.

Currently (before this PR) we have some of things it would need - with gaps:
- Operations API - query only, and limited to one namespace.
- Operation change events - oddly side-car attached to the main application events, without sophisticated filtering

So this PR proposes we create a proper separation of concerns between the components that have super-access to update FireFly state, because they are part of it (the `admin` API already exists for this), and the external API that applications use.

- Adding `GET` `/admin/api/v1/operations` routes - including a `PUT` to update operation status (per same rules that apply to internal plugins like Data Exchange today)
- **Moving** the database change events firehose WebSocket to `/admin/ws` with extra options, and a simplified no-confirm model. It's best effort up to a buffer size, and then operation of the core is prioritized over avoiding any event loss, and always ephemeral. No guarantees.

                In diagnosing a recent issue, I noticed that the `payloadRef` of a batch is a Database stored field, but is never set when you query in the database.

This is because we were writing it when we sealed the batch for delivery, but then overwriting it when we confirmed the batch.

It also had `VARCHAR(64)` in PSQL and `VARCHAR(256)` in SQLite.

The code actually only _needed_ it to pass the `payloadRef` from the batch upload operation, to the batch pin operation. Instead of relying on that, I've added it explicitly to the inputs of the Batch Pin operation - which overall feels much more consistent.

Then I've removed the DB field (for newly created envs - it nullable so no need for a migration to remove it).

I had to update the operations interface to return the outputs though, as it wasn't currently.

Unrelated fix - the `json:` tag on `Group` was wrong on `BatchPersisted` so we were returning `Group` rather than `group` on the JSON.
