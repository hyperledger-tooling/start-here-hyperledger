                Initialises a boilerplate react native library for the indy-vdr wrapper. This does not contain any wrapper functionality, but it is just done in order to make the upcoming PRs less polluted.

the wrapper does have its own .gitignore, if that is not preferred I can remove it and add it to the main .gitignore.

@TimoGlastra Is there something I have to add here for the setup? So that it is inline with AFJ, Bifold, etc.

- basic wrapper functionality should come rather soon.
