                - Builds on pr #88 
- Setups up a React Native library. This does not include the example app. Another PR will be created later on when Expo adds support for React Native 0.68.0. This will allow for a very minimal example app (does not include `android/` and `ios/`.
- No included functionality so the following PRs will only have functional code.
