- auto merge the main branch into the a feature brach when a pull request is labeled with `autoupdate`. The idea of this improvement is to optimize the work of the engineers: engineer shouldn't keep an eye on the PR and press "Update..." button after each successful merge of another PR into the main branch. The bot will do this work for you.

                ### Description: 
SDJWT
This feature enables the creation of credentials bound to the holder's key.
Verifiers can now use a challenge and domain to verify the holder's binding to the credential.
If a `keyId`  is provided (an optional field) when the holder accepts the offer, the holder's key will be bound to the credential.
If the `keyId` is not provided, holder key binding is not supported.
During verification request if the domain and challenge is requested, the key binding is necessary to support this flow and key bouded to the credential is used

Link to existing ADR (Architecture Decision Record), if any. If relevant, describe other approaches explored and the selected approach. Documenting why the methods were not selected will create a knowledge base for future reference, helping prevent others from revisiting less optimal ideas.
