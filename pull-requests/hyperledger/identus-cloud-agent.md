                ### Description: 

`CredentialIssuer` update api should have parity with the create model. Added a `client_id` and `client_secret` patch. 


### Alternatives Considered (optional): 
Link to existing ADR (Architecture Decision Record), if any. If relevant, describe other approaches explored and the selected approach. Documenting why the methods were not selected will create a knowledge base for future reference, helping prevent others from revisiting less optimal ideas.
