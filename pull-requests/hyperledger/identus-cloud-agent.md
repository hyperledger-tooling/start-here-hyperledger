This PR make use of published keycloak plugin instead of bulding from plugin source inside this repo.

### Alternatives Considered (optional): 
Link to existing ADR (Architecture Decision Record), if any. If relevant, describe other approaches explored and the selected approach. Documenting why the methods were not selected will create a knowledge base for future reference, helping prevent others from revisiting less optimal ideas.
