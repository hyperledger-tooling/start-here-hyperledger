### Description: 

This this PR https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent/pull/1121, we switch to `ubuntu-latest` because our `self-hosted` were offline. Now we have our runners online, we should switch back since the CI job took much longer to execute.

- took 26m on `ubuntu-latest` https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent/actions/runs/9317151746
- took 16m on `self-hosted` https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent/actions/runs/9283779143

### Alternatives Considered (optional): 
Link to existing ADR (Architecture Decision Record), if any. If relevant, describe other approaches explored and the selected approach. Documenting why the methods were not selected will create a knowledge base for future reference, helping prevent others from revisiting less optimal ideas.
