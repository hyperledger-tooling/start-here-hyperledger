                The following error was being returned when using the latest
version of sphinx:

<openapi>:1:Problem in http domain: field is supposed to use role 'obj',
but that role is not in the domain.

This is caused by an incompatibility with the current version of
sphinxcontrib-httpdomain. The issues does not exist in sphinx 0.4.
