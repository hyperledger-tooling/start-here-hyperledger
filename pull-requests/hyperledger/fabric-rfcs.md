                This RFC suggests to decouple the Fabric ordering service codebase into
a framework that can be used for implementing various consensus mechanisms
without changing the Fabric codebase itself, in contrast to the current state of affairs.

It also proposes an alternative authentication mechanism for inter-orderer communication.
