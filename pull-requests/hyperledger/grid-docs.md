                This change adds the feature doc for a proposed High- and Low-level transaction REST API.  The design goal is to all for clients to submit transactions in a simplified manner, using standard JSON structs, removing the need to use or understand the binary wire protocols, as well as the need for any grid-specific client SDKs.
