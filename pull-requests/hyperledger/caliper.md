## Checklist
 - [ ]  A link to the issue/user story that the pull request relates to
 - [x]  How to recreate the problem without the fix
   - The link to Hyperledger Fabric configuration on [https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/) gives a 404 error on being clicked
 - [ ]  Design of the fix
 - [ ]  How to prove that the fix works

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
The current documentation release v0.4.2 is the one being referenced so I kept the link for the new Fabric confic docs instead of the previous broken link.
