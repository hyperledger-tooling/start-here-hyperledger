## Issue/User story
This pull request addresses the issue where the Hyperledger Fabric logo was not displayed on the landing page, as described in issue #1531 .

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Hyperledger Caliper landing page.
2. Scroll down to the "Supported Blockchains" section.
3. Notice the absence of the Hyperledger Fabric logo, with only the alt text visible.

## Design of the fix
The fix involved adding the missing logo image to the assets directory and updating the HTML source to point to the correct image file location. The previous image no longer existed.

## Validation of the fix
The fix was validated locally by refreshing the landing page and confirming that the Hyperledger Fabric logo is now displayed correctly.

## Automated Tests
No automated tests were added as this fix is related to the static content of the website.

## What documentation has been provided for this pull request
The change is self-documenting; the addition of the image file is the only update required.
