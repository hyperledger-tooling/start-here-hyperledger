                An initial draft of 0.2.x to 0.3.x migration guide. It currently covers:

- Agent constructor changes
- Modules extracted from the Core (Action Menu and Question Answer)
- Discover Features API changes
- Ledger API changes
- New module/plug-in API (AgentContext, registration, etc.)
- Proofs API changes (not completed yet)
- Proof Storage changes (TODO, initial copy-paste from credentials)
- Out Of Band for connection-less proofs API (TODO, not sure if needed) 

Any help would be appreciated, especially on Proof Exchange Records  as I haven't used its API a lot previously.
