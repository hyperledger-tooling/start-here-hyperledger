                This PR updates lots of dependencies to address all open CVEs, including in the smart contract build/test toolchain itself.

Note this branch is branched off of: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/pull/135
I recommend reviewing/merging that PR first which should reduce the diff to a single commit here.
