                As a consequence of discussions on `iroha-java` documentation it was decided that the best course of action is to add examples directly to the `iroha-java` repository so that they can be referenced from the `iroha2-docs` with `#region` and `#end_region`.

The code in `examples/tutorial` is taken from the documentation site [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/kotlin-java.html)

removed `sample-app` because it wasn't part of the project structure and wasn't being checked in the CI. Refer to projects in the `example` directory. ATM, there is only `tutorial` but others are expected to be added as required
