                This updates the React peer dependency to 18.0.0 as part of an effort to update Aries Bifold to newer versions of React Native. 

This would be considered a breaking change according to Semver due to the peer dependency change (via https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/502)

                I think the switch to tsoa has improved the OpenAPI spec quite a lot. However, there are a few drawbacks (mainly related to the issues https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa/issues/1268, https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa/issues/1267 & https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa/issues/1266). 

I think it is fine for now, but if there are better alternatives i'd be happy to change it. It isn't that much work if we don't combine it with a major AFJ release :).
