                This PR includes a refactor of the current react-hooks extension including:
* Updated AFJ dependency to the official 0.2.0 release
* Base record events are now handled as opposed to events for each specific record type
* Introduces a typed reducer hook factory to handle record actions in providers
* Uses agent event observable stream to allow for introduction of rxjs operators
