            <td>
                Fixes:

- Improved formatting on various data summaries
- Presentations are now auto loaded on entering verification section
- Added status icons to credentials and presentations
  - Enabled removal of listings that were grouped by status. Now, each item is all in one list but status is indicated. This significantly simplified code in a few places.
- Make sure select inputs have English "no data" warnings instead of Chinese
- Add context menus (enables copy/paste through right clicks)
- Disable presentation proposal (which is not currently functional)
- Visual improvements for Agent List window
- Use enter key for triggering form actions where it makes sense
