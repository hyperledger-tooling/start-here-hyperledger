                This PR updates the encryption envelope library to the most recent version which includes helpers for dealing with signed attachments in DIDComm messages.

In the toolbox, as developer oriented piece of software, signatures on messages sent during connection establishment are currently not being properly verified. As we move into OOB/DID Exchange support, we will be required to both verify signatures as well as provide signatures on our DID Exchange request. This PR adds the necessary building blocks to make this possible.
