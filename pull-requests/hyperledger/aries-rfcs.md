                The vast majority of the changes are just to add "mailto:" to the front of the email addresses in the RFCs -- that was missed in the templates, and it carried into the RFCs themselves.

A few other cleanups of paths, and tweaks to the generator.  In the process, a couple of clarifications were made -- minor, to do with things that have changed over time.

Almost got it right. Just a tweak needed...

                A PR that might trigger the publication of a GH Pages site - depending on the success of the included GHAction. I tested it as much as I could.

In theory, this should create a gh-pages branch from which we can publish the site. The gh-pages static content will be based on the docs generated by the GHAction. From there we can publish it.

As noted on the Aries Working Group call (20240327) this is the start of the work on this, there are some todos that will be added as issues to be worked on.

This should be a "do no harm" PR -- it shouldn't affect anything other than adding a gh-pages branch in the repo.
