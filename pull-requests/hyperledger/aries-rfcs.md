                A couple of RFCs' JSON examples don't display properly in deployed site, so I ran a formatter over it to resolve the issues (the ```json= is the primary problem). The issue can be observed here: https://hyperledger.github.io/aries-rfcs/latest/features/0685-pickup-v2/#reference
Also updates RFC 0496 to be in ADOPTED category in mkdocs/index (#834)

                Fixes favicon/logo from #837. For some reason using the relative path works fine locally but not once deployed. I'll see if I can get to some of the actual items on the list too given I can now run locally.
