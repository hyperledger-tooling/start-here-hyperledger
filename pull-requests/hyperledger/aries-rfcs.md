                Initial draft PR. Still needs some things resolved and would be best if we merge it after the issues discussed at IIW are resolved. This mainly involves updating the BBS+ LD Proofs spec and defining how private holder binding can be achieved.

                As discussed on the WG call a few weeks ago. The did exchange protocol required the `thid` property to be equal to the message ID. This is an unnecessary restriction

                Simplify please ack decorator for inclusion in AIP 2.0 (#632). I simplified it to the most basic version where you can only indicate whether you want an ack on RECEIPT or OUTCOME. 

I'm not sure if I removed too much, but I think this basic variant will be quite easy to implement for agents, while still providing a lot of value.

@dhh1128 as the original author of the RFC, what do you think?
