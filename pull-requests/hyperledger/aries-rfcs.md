                Per the addition to the goal codes list -- useful when you want to do a connection-less present proof using a QR code, but the OOB message is too large for the QR code, and URL shortening is not an option.  With this, establish the connection, do the present proof protocol, and delete the connection.

BTW -- not sure where is the best place to create a repository of goal codes to use.  We should discuss that as part of the review of this PR.
