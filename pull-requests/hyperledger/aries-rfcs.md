                We have many RFCs that are in the "Proposed" status that are very unlikely to be progressed any further. To clear them out so that people have a better view of the active work in Aries, a new status "STALLED" has been added, and the status of many proposed RFCs have been changed to either STALLED, DEMONSTRATED or ACCEPTED, as appropriate based on the work done on the RFCs.

STALLED differs from the RETIRED state in that STALLED is direct from PROPOSED, whereas RETIRED is from a more advanced state, where implementation work was done, evaluated and found to be no longer of use.  STALLED just means that the idea never got beyond the idea stage.
