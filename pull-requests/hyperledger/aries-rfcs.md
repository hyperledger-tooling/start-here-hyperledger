                Saw that RFC 0510 and 0646 were still in proposed state, even though they are included in AIP2.0

Not sure what to do with the links in the AIP RFC, as it seems they all use the same commit. Can I just update the link to the newer commit for these two RFCs? No change has been made besides the `proposed` -> `accepted`
