                This PR is a new RFC proposing that verifiable credential issuers of attributes that contain or than strings and numbers use Data URLs (IETF Standard 2397) to convey to Holders and Verifiers the MIME Type and encoding of the attribute. This is particular useful for use cases of photos in attributes, and for attributes that hold a JSON data structure, such as an array of values.
