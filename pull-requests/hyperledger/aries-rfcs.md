                Fixes typo found in the Aries RFC. The other supporting documents such as the Excel file for building an OCA file, and the example OCA Bundles have the attribute name, `credential_help_text`, as does the JavaScript implementation of OCA published from the [Aries Bifold](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native) repository. In my checking, all OCA Bundles that have been created that I could find are including the `_text`. 

This PR corrects the text in the actual RFC.

Wish we had caught this earlier...
