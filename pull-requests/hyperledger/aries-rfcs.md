            <td>
                Further updates to AIP 2.0 following recent merges and discussions in the community. Changes:

- updates the commits for 0453 Issue Credential and 0454 Present Proof to the latest that clarifies the 2.0 versions of the protocols, including that payments have never been implemented nor are planned. The latest commits of the RFCs revert the 2.1 and 2.2 versions of the protocols, and are up to date with the current implementations.
- Removes 0627 Static Peer DIDs (a recently retired RFC) that is no longer relevant in the community. Update reflects that `peer:did:4` are preferred, but `2` and `1` are in use as well.
- Updates the change log.
