                Per the Aries Mobile Summit (2021.11.16), it's time to trigger the community transition from Connections to DID Exchange.  This PR sets the Transtion RFC to `Approved` and set the date for all Aries deployments to achieve Step 1 to the end of 2021.

For Aries framework builders and Aries agent deployers: When you have completed Step 1, please add a PR to this repo that updates the "Implementation Table" in the PR with your status towards meeting the 2021.12.31 deadline.

Please notify others in your sphere about this transition.
