@hartm -- notice that I included you. That is specifically because of your cryptology knowledge, it's importance in Hyperledger AnonCreds and your knowledge of the cryptology being used here. I would not suggest this for other projects. I will understand if you would prefer not to be included.

@TelegramSam and @mikelodder7 -- I also included you in this file -- please take a look and explicitly agree to be included.

The same PR will be added and merged into the other repos.

Need to add updates to the Maintainer file as part of this effort.
