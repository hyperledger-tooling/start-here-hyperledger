                The population of the Privacy and Security considerations sections. I was not able to find a lot of source material for this, so much of this is new text. I used several other related specs, including the W3C VC specification for topics to be included. If anyone knows of sources of this material, please add a comment to this PR and I'll see about incorporating that content.

In reviewing this, the main concern should be errors vs. clarifications and additions. Where the sections are insufficiently populated or missing content, we can revise/extend the text.  We don't want incorrect information pushed out even temporarily.

Feedback welcome!

                This is a start to address the issue I raised in #181. 

Not made it all the way through the spec yet - at about Section 7. I seem to be making a fair few changes here, so comments and feedback welcome as I go.

Also, I recommend we update the following diagrams:

- AnonCreds data objects in the introduction. Suggest: remove blinded link secret from holder entirely
- 8. Issuance Flow. Suggest we add a step before 13 that is something like: Remove blinding factor
