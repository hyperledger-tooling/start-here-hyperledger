                The population of the Privacy and Security considerations sections. I was not able to find a lot of source material for this, so much of this is new text. I used several other related specs, including the W3C VC specification for topics to be included. If anyone knows of sources of this material, please add a comment to this PR and I'll see about incorporating that content.

In reviewing this, the main concern should be errors vs. clarifications and additions. Where the sections are insufficiently populated or missing content, we can revise/extend the text.  We don't want incorrect information pushed out even temporarily.

Feedback welcome!
