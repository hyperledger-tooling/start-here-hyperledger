                what's new:
- added a home page with a nice layout
- split docs in 3 different parts as we discussed: get started, developer guide, api reference
- added navigation at the top (3 doc parts + troubleshooting)
- added an index page for get started section

open questions:
- the naming of doc sections (get started, developer guide, api reference) -- if anyone has better ideas, please share
- one of the topics is not included in any table of contents: the `documenting/snippets` page is not a part of any doc part, idk if it even needs to be in our docs or not
- the docs don't follow SORA color theme, it's all default blue @0x009922 could you help with this? I think it'd be nice to have at least the home page with a custom SORA theme
