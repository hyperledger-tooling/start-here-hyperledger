                Addresses #79.
I am not sure if we should merge this before we figure out the versioning strategy (#89) for the tutorial.

                When working through the tutorial I've found some issues with code samples, I'm sharing updates that should work with recent iroha2. `roses#wonderland` are no longer mintable for alice (since she didn't create them, I think I saw some issue regarding this on the main repo), so I've changed it to `time` with a note that proper mintable type must be set.
