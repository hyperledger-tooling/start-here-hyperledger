                I am unsure of many details to put into the distribution and shell path updates, so I'll leave it as a draft. I am thinking about Ubuntu, Arch, and maybe some RedHat distros. As for the shells: Fish, Bash, and ZSH should be enough. Any ideas?

                We mention old release candidate versions in some places, and while it's not a priority, how about adding this change?
Maybe we can refer to `rc.15` at this point, but I am using https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/client_cli/Cargo.toml as a reference for now.
