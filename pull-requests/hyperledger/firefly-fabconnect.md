                Note the usage of the go.mod `replace` to point to the `is-init` branch on the `kaleido-io` fork, as we expect the PR (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/236) to take some time to be reviewed and merged. This is only temporary and will be removed once the PR is merged.
