                This PR fixes various typos, formatting issues, and broken links, focusing on the FAQ and the 1.2 docs. It isn't comprehensive but I wanted to get  this in as a milestone along the docs review process before I get further, as the diff's already getting large. I'm happy to discuss any of the changes here or on discord (sawtooth-contributors).

This also fixes #188 and fixes https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues/2448.
