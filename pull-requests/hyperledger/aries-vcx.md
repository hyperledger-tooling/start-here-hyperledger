- This legacy ios wrapper is added temporarily to make transition smoother and it's expected to be removed in soon future. The main wrapper is `wrappers/ios`

                This was written purely to explore the Actix framework and its viability in aries-vcx integration tests.

As you can see, it can be used, but the benefits outside of perhaps saving a few lines per integration test are unclear. On the other hand, there are glaring drawbacks:
* async code in `handle` method [can't use](https://github.com/actix/actix/issues/308) (or at least trivially) the reference to `self` and thus a necessity for cloning in the handler, or
* having to clone the agent in the tests (since the `start()` method consumes the agent), or
* having to store handled messages in the agent itself (unlike when using a channel with a capacity).

In addition, it seems far from certain that actix would stay maintained for long. Here is a citation from the actix docs:
> Long ago, Actix Web was built on top of the actix actor framework. Now, Actix Web is largely unrelated to the actor framework and is built using a different system. Though actix is still maintained, its usefulness as a general tool is diminishing as the futures and async/await ecosystem matures. At this time, the use of actix is only required for WebSocket endpoints.

Again, this was just an exploration, so if you don't think the benefits outweigh the costs, feel free to close this PR.
