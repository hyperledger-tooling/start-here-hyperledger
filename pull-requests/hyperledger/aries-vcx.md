- Reorganize files in `aries_vcx_core` such that all wallet APIs are under `aries_vcx_core/wallet` module
- Reorganize `aries_vcx_core` to move files out of `src/indy` into `src/anoncreds` / `src/ledger` / `src/wallet` to keep things together. Previously things been a bit scatter in `src/indy` and other directories.

                One less thing to worry about - since "mixed breed" testing profile was introduced, we have increased coverage with different profile significantly, and also introduced 4x different testing combinations on `libvcx_core` level.

                This reverts commit be57e49e5fb15c790e68d8f060e8328922a7e7a1 / https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/895

The PR is causing CI to fail, because it added migrator as dependency of `libvcx_core`. The migrator imports `ariesvcx_core` with `modular_libs` feature, I believe that's the culprit of the issues - as both vdrtool and indyvdr become part of the build - altough seems to work with major scenarios, in tests etc, there are probably some interplay of dependencies during the build process when building for ios/android/linux musl (napi wrapper build)

Strategic way to go about this is to to default to `indy-vdr` ledger client, delete vdrtools based ledger client (and therefore the zmq dependencies coming from `vdrtools`) and then re-apply the changes in reverted commit. 
That might solve the issue, or at least make it simpler to investigate.
