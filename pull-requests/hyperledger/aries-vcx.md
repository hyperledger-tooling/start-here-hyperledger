                At high level, this re-enables building aries-vcx, aries-vcx-core without any features enabled. Comes along with some refactoring to make sense of things and prepare ground for gradual removal of vdrtools based components.

- `aries-vcx-core`: define more granular features - this will come handy in subsequent PR's removing parts of vdrtools `vdrtools_anoncreds`, `vdrtools_wallet`, `vdrtools_ledger`
- move non-indy specific files out of indy directories (eg `ToBaseAgencyClientWallet` moved from `aries_vcx_core::wallet::indy::agency_client_wallet` to `aries_vcx_core::wallet::agency_client_wallet`
- `aries-vcx-core`: include `indy-api-types` as dependency to access `indy_api_types::errors` directly to simplify error mapping (`aries_vcx_core/src/errors/mapping_vdrtools.rs` )
- remove support for `vdrtools` based ledger client from `did_resolver_sov` - it was causing some complications which won't be relevant as soon as this https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/914 get merged

                ## This is a **POC**.

Reimplementation of the `Connection` protocol by making state machines transitions infallible and adding a handler layer on top. This makes transitions completely I/O-less.

The handler layer would take care of retrieving/inserting state machines through an interface, and then handle message processing as usual, without the users needing to know/deal with implementation details of the protocols or state machines.

The `Connection` trimmed down states are due to the handler layer abstracting operations, hence making some states simply redundant. For instance, `Initial` states have no purpose anymore, while something like an `InviteeConnection<Invited>` also makes no sense. The handler layer processes an invitation and directly generates a `Request` that can then be sent by consumer code, thus putting the state machine directly in `Requested`.

One caveat that I don't really have a strong opinion over is the fact that the `InviterConnection` only has one state now: `Complete`. 

As an inviter, you generate an invitation and doing that within the state machine does not make sense because:
- for public invitations, you're expecting multiple people to respond, without knowing how many will -> the protocol really started when `Request` messages start coming in.
- for pairwise invitations, you're only expecting one `Request` from the other peer -> so, with the proposed implementation, the information of whether the `Invitation` was responded to or not is not being tracked by us, but there's nothing stopping users from keeping track of it themselves, especially since the invitation is created outside of the state machines.

Then, after receiving a `Request`, you will process it and generate a `Response` which the consumer code can send. We then consider the state machine to be complete, losing the information of whether the other party sent a message or not after the consumer code sends the `Response`. This is because we would have to handle **any** message for determining that, and this bit of information might not even be relevant to some users. If it is, it can also be handled in consumer code.

DidExchange does this much better by standardizing the acknowledgement of the `Response`, which pretty much any communication protocol worth its bacon does. Since there's no standard for `Connection` and anything flies, as well as this being an old protocol which is technically superseded by `DidExchange`, I suggest to leave it to users keep track of this separation between *response sent and message received* and *response sent but no message received yet*.
