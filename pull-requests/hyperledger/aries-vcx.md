                    Eradicate mediated connection from issuance and presentation integration tests, part 1

            <td>
                Reduces the number of issuance and presentation integration tests relying on mediated connection to exchange messages instead of exchanging them directly between the SM handlers, with the goal of removing their dependency on agency client and MediatedConnection and eventually making the integration tests runnable without a mediator.

This change results in a minor test speedup, however the main bottleneck is schema / cred. def. creation, which can be mediated by sharing schemas / credential definitions between tests wherever possible.
