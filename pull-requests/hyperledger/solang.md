                Hi there, 
I would like to add some derive `Serialize, Deserialize` over most of the objects. 
This will permit us to get the **AST** in **JSON** and then help us interface with **JSON** tools already created.
Thanks!

                This PR includes many changes in order to enable Borsh encoding everywhere on Solana. Here is a list of all of them:

1. Borsh encoding is used whenever we need to encode or decode things on Solana.
2. There is now a single interface for AbiEncoding that is used by both Borsh and Scale codecs.
3. CFG expressions the encoder normally utilizes are now wired up in constant folding and strength reduce to optimize the output.
4. All Solana runtime tests now use `BorshToken` for arguments and returns instead of `ethabi::Token`.
5. Integration tests and Anchor tests underwent many changes to accommodate the new encoding scheme.
6. `ethabiencoder.rs` has been deleted.
7. Borsh encoding now saves to a variable all basic types that are read from buffer. This made the code less optimal, but solved the problem with `Expression::ReturnData`. A fix has been suggested int #1054.


Integration tests are failing because the Typescript library needs [this PR](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-solidity.js/pull/44) merged in order to work.
