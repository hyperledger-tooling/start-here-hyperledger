                Every CI run we get tons of warnings like:

The `set-output` command is deprecated and will be disabled soon. Please upgrade to using Environment Files.

It looks like actions-rs/toolchain is unmaintained:

Many projects are switching over to dtolnay/rust-toolchain, let's do the same.

                This solidity was not rejected and causes a panic in emit, because rationals should be compile-time constants.

                In order to integrate with Anchor, Solang needs to support discriminators. This PR refactors the Solana target so that it works with eight byte discriminators instead of four byte selectors.

The discriminator depends only on the name of a function, so function overloading has been disabled in this PR (for Solana).

The Anchor and Solana integration tests are failing, because we need to merge [this PR](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-solidity.js/pull/47) in the `@solana/solidity.js` repository and release a new version of the library.

            <td>
                My original plan was to hack the substrate emit phase to always return a `Result` type (`Ok` variant which is just a single null byte), so that the `LanguageError` from `ink!` version 4 is respected when calling a solidity contract from `ink!`. But while doing so I realized: Currently the only way to call a solidity contract from `ink!` is to use the low level `CallBuilder` interface anyways. And since this interface does not care at all about the `LanguageError`, everything still works. So now, instead of hacking around in emit and holding up the next solang release, I'd rather implement the `LanguageError` story cleanly after the release (IIRC it means refactoring the scale encoder into codegen and then implementing the `Result` type).
