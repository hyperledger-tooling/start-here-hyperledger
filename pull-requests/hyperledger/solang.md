                The contract I added in the tests was working properly in Solang v0.3.0, but it caused a panic in [this line](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/blob/a84b0ad3b67a17b524ef6b7437fd4c5376833807/src/codegen/strength_reduce/expression_values.rs#L79) on the main branch. 

I couldn't identify what has changed from the release till now, but I deemed the logic for reporting undefined variables and stop optimizations erroneous.

                This PR adds a public way to get the file contents from a file number. I've defaulted to a verbose function name, but happy to change that if folks like (e.g., maybe just `get_contents(file_no: usize)`, but that's a little awkward because of `set_contents(path: &str, contents: String)`... I feel like `get_XXX` and `set_XXX` should have the same type for `XXX` (in this case `file_no`'s `usize` would conflict with `path`'s `&str`)

                The contract linked at #1367 calls `vector_new` too many times, because the runtime error strings are dynamically allocated during execution. This PR makes the runtime error strings constant attributes in LLVM, so they are not allocated.

In addition, this PR has these changes:
1. The test case caused a stack overflow in constant folding, so I split `fn expression` into multiple small functions.
2. `log_runtime_error` contained repeated code for both targets and has been removed from the `trait TargetRuntime`.
3. `error_message_with_loc` now adds the new line character.

                Exposes a low-level builtin function for calling `seal_set_code_hash`. The code hash arguments is of type ~~`bytes`~~ `uint8[N]` intentionally (and not of type `Hash`, so that it matches the the pointer expected by the API function. `Hash`, which is just an alias to `bytes32`, will internally be represented as an `i256`. I came to the conclusion that, given this type conversion can easily be written in Solidity, we do and should not want to deal with that in the compiler, be it in emit or in codegen or elsewhere. 
Instead, a more high level function, that asks for a `Hash` argument and converts that to ~~`bytes`~~ `uint8[N]`, should rather be implement in the substrate Solidity library (once we have it).
Additionally, if some parachain decides to use a hash longer than 32bytes, using just a ~~`bytes`~~ `uint8[N]` pointer will still work.

                This PR creates the infrastructure for accessing accounts with `tx.accounts.account_name`. Presently, we can only access accounts declared with the `@payer` annotation, but our goal is to make this possible for all accounts declared with annotations (this is not implemented yet). 

The documentation I wrote is very terse, because my plan is to add more details when I have the `@reader`, `@mutable`, `@signer` and `@mutableSigner` implemented.
