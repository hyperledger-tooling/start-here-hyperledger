                - used cbindgen to create a header file
- Nodejs wrapper + tests
- React Native wrapper (for now without example app)
- Build workflow for ios and android

This PR contains a lot of `@TS-ignores` and those will be fixed in the near future as a seperate PR. I mainly wanted to merge the working version and do cleanup afterwards so integration can happen faster. 

@andrewwhitehead is there any strategy for a PR like this? Its 18.7k lines with quite a bit of wrapper repitition.
