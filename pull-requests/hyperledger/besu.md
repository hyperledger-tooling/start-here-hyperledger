* Upgrade reftests to 13.3
* Implement retroactive EIP-7610

We need to do both of these at once as the reference tests needed to be
updated to reflect the changes in the retroactive EIP.

Signed-off-by: Danno Ferrin <danno@numisight.com>


## Fixed Issue(s)

This does not fix #6984, even though there are reftests.  The tests are disabled not only Besu doesn't implement the reftests, but because they were filled with a version of Prague that does not implement EIP-6110. Blockchain tests need to remain disabled until there is a 13.4 with 6110 or a 14.0 version.

In a previous PR we made the change to disconnect the peer that was selected to provide the range headers that we need as input for the chain downloading pipeline for useless responses after a number of retires. To make sure that these useless peers are disconnected this PR increments the retry count for any exception that happens while trying to get these headers.

In addition this PR throws an exception after disconnecting the useless peer so the pipeline is immediately  restarted with a new target peer.

Further improvements to fix the world state halts and some cases of the chain halt.

- Added pivot block checks back into the snap sync pipeline to prevent world state halting due to not having the current pivot block. The World State pipeline could halt due to a chain halt since it depended on block added events to check for new pivot blocks.
- Made the pivot block check in the snap worldstate pipeline async and this was called on the block added event from the chain download pipeline and blocked the import thread
- Added time to the pivot block selector and decreased the timeout in the DynamicPivtoBlockSelector from 5 minutes to 20 seconds
- Disconnect peers when we only receive a partial response for block headers after multiple tries. Some nodes were only sending a response of a single header instead so we would get stuck in the chain download.

This PR adds a new long-running acceptance test that is designed as a soak test for BFT chains.

It is disabled by default (i.e. `acceptanceTestCliqueBft` does not run this test) but can be run as an individual acceptance test with `./gradlew acceptanceTestBftSoak`.

The current acceptance test tasks for gradle have not been updated to run the new test to ensure that PRs do not require an hour-long test before being mergeable. It is intended to be run manually by anyone who wants to easily run a soak test of the latest code on a QBFT or IBFT chain. Future discussions with the maintainers might decide to add the test somewhere else in the release pipeline.

By default the test runs for 60 minutes, but can be run for much longer by configuring the `acctests.soakTimeMins` system property in `build.gradle`. It has been tested for runs of up to 6 hours so far.

Here's a summary of what the test does:

1. Creates a 4-validator QBFT chain with `berlin` fork
2. Starts the nodes
3. Deploys a smart contract to create some initial state
4. Attempts to deploy a `shanghai` contract and checks that it fails
5. Lets the chain continue mining empty blocks for a proportion of the total run time (e.g. for a 60 minute run it will do this step for 10 minutes)
   - Every minute it checks that the chain height is increasing, with some tolerance allowed
6. Stops a node and checks the chain continues to mine blocks
   - Again every minute it checks that the chain height is increased, but with more tolerance for the slower mining rate
7. Stops another node and checks the the chain now stalls
8. Starts both of the stopped nodes. Waits for the chain to continue mining blocks again
9. Stops all of the nodes one-by-one, upgrading them from `berlin` to `london` fork
10. Checks that the chain continues mining new blocks once the nodes have restarted
11. Does another check that the state of the smart contract deployed at step 3 is correct (periodic updates are made to the state of the contract in between the other steps so the last check is to make sure the state is correct from the latest update)
12. Upgrades the chain from `london` to `shanghai`
13. Attempts to deploy the `shanghai` contract that failed at step 4 and checks that it was successful

If the test is configured to run for twice as long (e.g. 2 hours) each of the main steps runs for twice as long. The test cannot be configured to run for < 1 hour as the timings for the nodes resyncing & QBFT rounds being agreed upon after the chain has stalled have minimum reliable values. There's not theoretical upper limit to how long the test can run for.

Future additions I'd like to add to the test:
 - ~Upgrade the chain from `london` to `shanghai` and check that the `shanghai` contract is deployed successfully~ Added under the latest commit
