This is a complete implementation of EIP-7692 EOF v.1

A video walkthrough of the diff is available [here](https://youtu.be/Dl-PV55OnA0)

One important change from the video is the introduction of a "PragueEOF" fork, which is Prague + EOF.  When scheduling a fork via the genesis file or the `evmtool`'s trace facility, you will use "PragueTime" to mean only scheduled prague EIPs, and "PragueEOFTime" for Prague + EOF.  However, reference tests will continue to use PrageEOF as the fork basis, as many reference tests and EEST tests use Prague as the fork to test EOF features.  This fork is temporary and as actual ACD scheduling changes will be updated.

When allow_accountlist in "permissions_config.toml" have duplicate or incorrect Ethereum addresses the functionality is to throw IllegalStateException during start-up. Currently, the validation errors are ignored and not logged to the log file as well.
This change will ensure the config file is valid before starting up the node.

No that previous PR #7141 is merged and test reports are correctly updated when merging a PR on main branch, we can safely remove the steps that were added to support the transition.

This PR also increases the number of AT runners as a workaround for failing jobs, until we properly fix them.

Release process has been broken down to pre-release and release to allow user testing. This is not required and adds additional step. Release workflows are combined into a single release workflow which trigger on a release. Following diagram shows the structure of the release workflow. Workflow jobs `artifacts` and `hadolint` are triggered when a release created. This PR Closes #6994.

Follow up to #7141, to fix the acceptance test path, and adjust the query to correctly get the last PR merged by time, instead of by number.
There is also a fix to prevent recursively adding previous downloaded test results into new reports, with the result of running tests multiple times.
