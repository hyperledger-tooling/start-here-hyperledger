                Here's a breakdown of the PR:

- Splitting Bonsai: The PR aims to divide Bonsai into two packages

- Common Classes with a Prefix: The common part will include classes prefixed with "DiffBased." These classes are designed to provide a base for both Bonsai and any future storage format that might use this diff-based approach.

- Bonsai's Specifics: Bonsai will retain its unique features in its own package. This means that while it shares the diff-based infrastructure with the common part, it also has its own specific functionalities that are not shared with other storage format.

- Extension to Verkle: this modification add the possibility of adding "Verkle" as a new storage format based on the diff-based architecture. Like Bonsai, Verkle would use the common diff-based classes but also have its own specific features.

In summary, the pull request proposes restructuring Bonsai to make it more modular and efficient. This not only improves data management within Bonsai but also sets the stage for incorporating new format like Verkle, which can share the common base while having their unique functionalities.

## PR description
BadBlockReason was an non-static inner enum in BadBlockCause and it was used in static context. This caused one of our custom errorprone checks to not pick up the "method param not final argument" correctly. Refactoring it out as an static top level class. Now all the checks are applied correctly.
