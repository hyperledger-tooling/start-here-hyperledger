## PR description

Two nodes stopped importing this weekend. This PR is a fix candidate. The nodes were late and some blocks were not stored in the pending blocks cache (because there is a size limit with announced blocks). At the time of importing the missing block, Besu did not find the block and stopped; Here is my theory. So I implemented a mechanism that directly asks the missing blocks to peers in these cases
