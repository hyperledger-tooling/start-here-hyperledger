1. Retrieve all transaction receipts in a block in 1 call to blockchain query instead of a call for each transaction in a block
2. Calculate transaction fee reward for miner based on `effectivePriorityFeePerGas` instead of `effectiveGasPrice` because `baseFee` would be burnt.

## PR description

This PR extends the transaction pool validator plugin, to also pass the `isLocal` and `hasPriority` attributes of the tx to validate
```
Optional<String> validateTransaction(
      final Transaction transaction, final boolean isLocal, final boolean hasPriority);
```
Then a renaming has been done, for making clear that this validator service only apply when adding a tx to the transaction pool, and not when doing other validations, like during block import, along with a refactor to align this service to the way TransactionSelectorService is managed.

Docs - can't see anywhere in the docs where we mention snap or checkpoint on the private networks side, but may be worth adding an explicit note that you must use FAST or FULL if using PoA consensus.

Track bad block causes in `BadBlockManager` in preparation for exposing plugin events.  This data is useful because a consumer may want to take a different action depending on the cause.  For example, for #6301, we probably want to trace blocks with an actual validation error and ignore blocks that just descend from a bad block. 

Summary of changes:
- Require a `BadBlockCause` when pushing blocks to `BadBlockManager`
- Simplify bad block checks by adding utility method `BadBlockManager.isBadBlock`
- Add some basic tests for `BadBlockManager`
- In event handler `MergeCoordinator.onBadChain`, only push descendants of the bad block to the`BadBlockManager`.  The bad block itself will already have been pushed into the `BadBlockManager` when processed in `MainnetBlockValidator` and the `MergeCoordinator` does not have the context on why the bad block was marked as bad.
- Remove unused API `MergeMiningCoordinator.addBadBlock`
- Fix / add tests to `MainnetBlockValidatorTest` 
   - Add tests for `fastBlockValidation()`
   - Set all mocks upfront to ensure every test executes from a baseline of success. Previously several tests were passing artificially.  The mocks were not set up correctly so some tests were not hitting the cases that were intended. 
- Create some factory methods on `InvalidBlockException` to handle cases where (previously required) block data is not available
- Disambiguate a few different types of errors in `DownloadHeaderSequenceTask` and add tests

## PR description
Fixes NPE when running the revert variables subcommand. 

Due to changes in how the data storage configuration is handled the approach of using the storage provider directly from the `BesuSubcommand` no longer works. Instead changed the approach that to use what was used in the trielog subcommands and creates the BesuController using the `BesuCommand.buildController()` to get access to the `StorageProvider`.

## PR description

This PR improved the quality of the txs that are kept in the prioritized layer of the layered txpool, taking in account also the dynamic value of the `minGasPrice` and `minPriorityFeePerGas` options.
So if a tx effective gas price is below the current value of `minGasPrice` or its effective priority fee is below the `minPriorityFeePerGas` it is not kept, or promoted, in the prioritized layer, since it will not be selected during block creation.
