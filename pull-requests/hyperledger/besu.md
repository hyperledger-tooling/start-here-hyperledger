Make the max code size and max initcode size a part of the EVM
configuration. As part of the change we need to move the tasks
CodeFactory once handled as a static class and move it into the EVM.
This has a nice follow on effect that we don't need to pass in max EOF
versions or max code sizes anymore.

This is also required to address a recent EOF change limiting the total size of containers.
