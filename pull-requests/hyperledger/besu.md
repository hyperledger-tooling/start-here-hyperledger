When choosing the "best" peer to try to confirm the pivot block
* ~~use the default comparator (TTD then chain height)~~ effectively the same
* remove the pre-requirement for the chain height estimate 
* don't disconnect the "worst" useless peer at this point
* and update the peer's chain height estimate if the pivot block is confirmed
* also allow 5 peers below the pivot block height since the chain height estimate we use for comparison can be wildly inaccurate

                ## PR description
Add additional detail when we disconnect with SUBPROTOCOL_TRIGGERED disconnect reason. I've extended the enum with additional SUBPROTOCOL_TRIGGERED values using the same code `0x10` and added a message to these extended `SUBPROTOCOL_TRIGGERED` reasons.

If we receive a `0x10` this is mapped back to the generic `SUBPROTOCOL_TRIGGERED` reason.

example with the changes
```
Disconnecting connection 1859339149, peer 0x6b8a113cb2edfa5d... reason 0x10 SUBPROTOCOL_TRIGGERED_MISMATCHED_NETWORK Mismatched network id

                _Sorry for the big PR! I tried to keep it more concise but lots of the pieces kinda work together so it was hard to separate them! Hopefully, it isn't too bad to review as a bulk of the changes are adding a parameter to a constructor or something like that..._ ❤️ 

This is an experimental implementation of [EIP-7002](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) logic for adding exits from the Validator Exit smart contract into blocks (and including them on the execution payload object of the Engine API).

**Summary of changes**
- Updated engine API method and ExecutionPayload structure to support exits
- Implemented Validator Exit Contract Helper (contract storage manipulation)
- Updated BlockCreator to include exits from the validator exit contract

fixes #6881 and #6882

**Open Questions/Future Improvements**
- ~~Do we need extra validation on `AbstractBlockProcessor` (e.g. check that we do not have more exits than expected). I have a feeling we do not need to as we are running the system logic as part of processing, so any difference between the exits in the block we are validating would be caught by a different exits_root post our processing. But I might be wrong. The same question applies to `MainnetBlockBodyValidator. validateBodyLight()`.~~
- The Validator Exits contract address might need to be parameterized for each network. The same applies to things like the maximum number of exits per block, etc.
- Do we need to have `ValidatorExitContractHelper` behind a protocol schedule setup in case the contract goes through some changes in future upgrades?
- We need to properly implement a system call to the Validator Exit contract, replacing the exiting contract storage manipulation in the Validator Exit Contract Helper. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/6918

## Engine API changes

Most of the logic was already there, few pieces had to be added (e.g. constructor parameters but the core of the logic hasn't changed). The more important change is how GetPayloadV4 includes the exits in the execution payload.

## Validator Exit Contract Helper

This is an initial implementation based on the work done by lightclient on the Validator Exit smart contract (https://github.com/lightclient/7002asm), and also using the bytecode defined in the EIP (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002#deployment).

Each exit uses 3 storage slots (each slot has 32 bytes). There is a bit of trickery to ensure they fit in exactly on 3 slots (some right/left padding depending on the field). The detailed diagram of the expected storage can be seen [in this code](https://github.com/lightclient/7002asm/blob/main/src/main.eas#L239-L251).

**UPDATE**: contract manipulation is not the best way of implementing this. The smart contract actually has all the logic to handle the system call. All we need to do is implement the mechanism to perform "send a tx" from the system account. I believe we do not have this logic in Besu at the moment, the closest thing I can think of is how we use a fake transaction in the `TransactionSimulator`, but we would need a way of ensuring that changes in contract storage are persisted. See https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/6918

## Including exits on blocks

The system call logic has been implemented in a way that manipulates the contract storage as if we were executing the call through the EVM (although no EVM is involved). ~~This seems to be the expected behaviour for system calls.~~ The heart of this is how `AbstractBlockCreator` uses `ValidatorExitContractHelper.popExitsFromQueue(..)`.

This PR adds `debug` level logs to the transaction processor in the event of either:

1. transaction processing halting (e.g. a post-shanghai transaction submitted to a pre-shanghai fork node)
2. the transaction reverting

Currently in order to see the reason for a transaction revert you typically have to either:

- Have `--revert-reason-enabled` on the node, and capture the revert reason in the application or trace the receipt response 
- Have the `DEBUG` JSON/RPC API enabled and use the `debug_traceTransaction` JSON/RPC call

In some scenarios it is useful not to have to enable revert reasons and or use JSON/RPC calls to see the revert reasons. Instead simply turning `DEBUG` logging on for the `MainnetTransactionProcessor` will now let you see the reason for a revert (or a halt).

I considered making it a `TRACE` log instead of `DEBUG` log but my view is that the output is fairly short (not lines and lines of output), transactions are unlikely to revert that frequently, and `TRACE` adds a fair amount of extra noise to the output. Happy to take others comments on whether it should be `TRACE` though.
