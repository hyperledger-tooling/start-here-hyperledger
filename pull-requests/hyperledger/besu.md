First part of series of PRs that will streamline license header in Java source files via spotless task. Developers who use IDEs to apply license headers should update their template based on `gradle/spotless/java.current.license` whose copyright notice is copied from https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Copyright+and+License+Policy

Once all the PRs are checked in, developers should be able to perform:
```
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```
and 
```
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

The CI should also report any missing or malformed license headers.

While working on optimizing the performance of the startup phase, specifically in regard to genesis file management, I found that there is a bit of tech debt accumulated in the way we manage genesis file and options, that makes it difficult to work with it, and makes the code fragile, so before posting the optimizations, this PR refactors the genesis file management to make it more uniform and also make sure that overrides are always applied, before trying to get any option.

Most of the changed files are related to renaming of change of types, while the core of the refactor is in `BesuCommand`, `BesuController` and `BesuControllerBuilder`.

In `BesuCommand` the genesis file and options are now provided by a supplier, that loads, and caches, them on first request, applying any CLI overrides at load time, and this simplify the workflow, since there is no more ad-hoc code to apply them in different places. Since `GenesisConfigOptions` are always accessible via `GenesisConfigFile` then we can just pass this to the `BesuControllor` simplifying the builder.

                ## PR description

The  docker build step can fail if `apt-get` gets it's dependencies from a transparent cache (e.g. from an ISP) and this cache serves corrupted or outdated packages. This PR clears all the apt-get cache first and afterwards executes the next steps while making sure that no cache whatsoever is used.

I have further split the the `RUN` command into several steps to make debugging easier, because like that the exact command that is failing while be shown. Right now we have several commands chained together and it's not always clear which of the several commands was failing.

## Fixed Issue(s)
fixes #7009

Enable JFR continuous profiling with default setting.
Java Flight Recorder (JFR) serves as an integrated mechanism within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for gathering, analyzing, and profiling information regarding the performance and memory usage of Java applications. Its design ensures minimal impact on performance, making it suitable for deployment in high-demand production settings.
With default setting, the impact on performance is less than 1 %.

Once the recording in place, we can either dump the recording from the last restart knowing that the recording is limited to 250 MiB, or start a second recording to have a recording you small set of data and in a controlled period.

**Configure the recording with default setting profile**
BESU_OPTS=-XX:StartFlightRecording,dumponexit=true,settings=default.jfc

**Check the recording**
sudo jcmd PID JFR.check

**Start a parallel recording**
sudo jcmd PID JFR.start

**Dump the profiling to a file**
Dump the default recording : sudo jcmd PID JFR.dump name=1 filename=FILEPATH
Dump the parallel recording : sudo jcmd PID JFR.dump name=2 filename=FILEPATH
