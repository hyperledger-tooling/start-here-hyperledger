Remove all EIP-3074 code from Besu. Since EIP-3074 has been replaced
with EIP-7702 in Pectra, and there is no intent to schedule it for a
future fork there is no need to retain the code.

Currently, trie keys generation will gather all transactions data and generate a single large batch of trie keys at once.
However, there are already mechanisms implemented in Besu to preload those trie keys in a background thread during block processing. 

This PR generates the different triekeys in the background in order to have a maximum of triekeys already calculated at the end of the block

                ## PR description
This PR changes BFT block proposal validation to not persist the changes as a result of the proposed block. When a QBFT `commit` message or Ethereum `NewBlock` message is processed the changes will still be persisted at that point.

Prior to this PR I could only get a few 1000 transactions through a 4-validator QBFT chain before I hit `Invalid block` error. With this fix in place I can run any number of high TPS tests against a 4-validator chain and have yet to see an `Invalid block` error.

## Fixed Issue(s)
Fixes https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/6680

(It might fix this issue, or there could still be something to resolve regarding the `RocksDB busy` error. I suspect this PR will improve the above issue at the very least, but suggest closing it with this PR and re-opening if it still occurs after this has merged)

The snap server responses must return at least one response item if the data can be retrieved according to the spec https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/snap.md. This applies to all the request types.

After making this change all the GetByteCodes hive tests are passing. Note still need to make a change to hive testsuite to enable snapserver before this will be seen.

Enable `--Xbonsai-limit-trie-logs-enabled` by default, unless sync-mode=FULL.
More info: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Limit+Trie+Logs+for+Bonsai

When sync-mode=FULL and data-storage-format=BONSAI you get a config validation error at startup...
```
besu --sync-mode=FULL --data-storage-format=BONSAI
2024-06-06 17:36:12.806+01:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Starting Besu
2024-06-06 17:36:13.027+01:00 | main | ERROR | Besu | Failed to start Besu
...
Cannot enable --Xbonsai-limit-trie-logs-enabled with sync mode FULL
```

I will promote to a Stable option in a separate PR.

This option has been tested on our canaries and by the community since https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/24.3.0

Added a fallback value for the option otherwise specifying --Xbonsai-limit-trie-logs-enabled on the command line, without a value, toggles it back off again.

The `minimalist-profile` has been updated from `bonsai-historical-block-limit=128` to `bonsai-historical-block-limit=512` to avoid further code changes and because I believe there is only a ~60MB difference so using 128 has limited value, see https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/6560#issuecomment-1953928253

I will conservatively set `Xbonsai-limit-trie-logs-enabled=false` in the `enterprise` profile for now as not sure it is desirable.

                ## PR description

Currently when Besu builds a block it takes and keep the lock on txpool, until the selection of txs to include is over (and this could be longer of the block creation timeout, since the tx that is processing across the timeout need to complete before releasing the lock) and that could delay the start of the next block building in case of small networks where single nodes could build many blocks in a row, for example L2 sequencers, but the optimization also benefit normal use cases, since incoming txs can be processed and added to the txpool concurrently to a block creation task.

Below there are 2 profiling taken, from a sequencer continuously building blocks,  before and after applying this PR, selected is the layered txpool, and you can see how the 
**Total Blocked Time** went down from >10min to millis.
