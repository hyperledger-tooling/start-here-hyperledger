The execution API marks the `v` field as optional for EIP-2930 and EIP-1559 transactions, preferring the `yParity` feld.  However, some tooling still depends on the presence of the `v` field. For those two transaction types both `v` and `yParity` will be returned now.

Update the interruption message for transaction selection to clarify that the process involves multiple transactions exceeding the configured time limit. This change aims to eliminate ambiguity, explicitly indicating that the interruption occurs when the cumulative selection process surpasses the configured duration, rather than being related to a single transaction.

Fixes BWS issue where we are unable to import blocks for some hashes. We are currently getting this log at the end of the BWS.

```
{"@timestamp":"2024-01-31T10:58:00,982","level":"WARN","thread":"ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-374","class":"MergeCoordinator","message":"Internal error, backward sync completed but failed to import finalized block 0xd12ec91829da5af65ba80696d035bac054b8aac7cfcf60c983c12a5bcb1b926e","throwable":""}
```

 This is due to adding hashes before have finished the initial sync and are ready to do a BWS.


Also moved the log message "Appending new head block hash {} to backward sync" into BackwardSyncContext so it is only logged if we are going to add the new block hash to the backward as may not kick off the BWS due to having not finished the initial sync.

The Engine API spec has been updated with Prague (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/prague.md). To help test the integration between CL and EL for EIP-6110 and EIP-7002, I have started working to move these methods from experimental into V4 (conditional to Prague activation).

At the moment, only deposit receipts are supported. I am adding support for validator exits as well. I can do it as a separate PR if it makes it easier to review etc. Just let me know.
