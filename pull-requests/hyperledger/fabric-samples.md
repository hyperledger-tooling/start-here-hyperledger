                This addresses Issue #504. This sample offers an option to run
a fabric network without using any containers at all. Used along
with the Nano Test Network, everything is run natively on the host
machine.

                Earlier compose version was giving a property error when running the [fabric-samples/test-network/network.sh](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/main/test-network/network.sh) script.

Docker Compose Documentation says that the property [networks:name](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#name-1) was added in [v2.1](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-21) file format.

Check if docker network is running. 
If network is not running exit
If running, and containers are present + certs are present skip network up
If running, containers are not present then we should networkUp
If containers exist but certs donâ€™t, bring network down and then networkUp

When containers are running but for some reason peerOrganisation dir was not present, the following error: 
`Failed to generate channel configuration transaction...` may be awkward to debug. So this is why there is a check to see if peerOrg does not exist but the containers do. 


Test Cases: 

1) Docker is not running 
```
./network.sh up createChannel -ca
Using docker and docker-compose
Creating channel 'mychannel'.
If network is not up, starting nodes with CLI timeout of '5' tries and CLI delay of '3' seconds and using database 'leveldb 
docker network is required to be running to create a channel
```

2) Docker is running but containers are not, peerOrganizations directory exists
```
./network.sh up createChannel -ca
Using docker and docker-compose
Creating channel 'mychannel'.
If network is not up, starting nodes with CLI timeout of '5' tries and CLI delay of '3' seconds and using database 'leveldb
