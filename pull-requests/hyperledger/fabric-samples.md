                This PR logs the Full Stack *workshop coding exercise* to the console, instead of leaving code hints in a commented-out TODO block.  Logging the TODOs to the console has two benefits: 

- Removes an annoying lint warning for unused variables.
- Displays a useful message to the console, explaining why Bananaman can not transfer a token to Appleman.   (In some cases of users running through the workshop, it was not clear that there was work to be done to implement this one-line function.)
