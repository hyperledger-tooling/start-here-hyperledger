                Add fabcar setup to fabric 2.x all-in-one startup script and adjust
healthcheck accordingly. Use fabric 2.x in cartrade and discounted
cartrade sample apps. No packages updated, fabric sdk 1.4.19 seems to
work fine with fabric 2.2 for now. Both samples has been tested and work
OK.

Closes: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues/1842

### Note: 
- Next step is to use basic asset transfer instead of depracated fabcar, so fabcar-cli-1.4 will be removed in the future (most probably).
- Upgrade of SDK seems to be complex task for now (since packages were re-organized), I think it'd be better to just focus on migration to common fabric connector.
