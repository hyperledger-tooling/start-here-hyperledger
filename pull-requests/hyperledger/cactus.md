                A second attempt at fixing the release automation.

The missing piece was that some of the Indy SDK dependencies
were not installed by default and we forgot to run the ci.sh
script to take care of that within this workflow action.

With this fix now we have an additional step in the action which
takes care of installing the OS level build dependencies for
the project.

Fixes #1951
Fixes #2069
Fixes #2175

                - Add a new package `@hyperledger/cactus-test-verifier-client` for verifier-client stress and
  functional tests that involve multiple packages.
- Add stress test for verifier-client that reports memory usage of repeated operation
  on `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio` connector plugin.
- Fix a memory leak in `SocketIOApiClient` - free socket listeners when they are no longer needed.
- Fix `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio` - use single a web3 connection
  (with keep-alive/reconnect) instead of spawning new one for each request.
  Previous solution was causing connection issues in stress testing.
