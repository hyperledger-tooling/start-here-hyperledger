                Specifies the --ignore-engines true parameter to be the default for
every yarn command contributors run within the project. This makes it
sligthly more convenient to work with yarn since now you can just say
"yarn install" instead of having to go with the much longer "yarn
install --ignore-engines". 

Of course in an ideal world we would not need
the --ignore-engines parameter but the Fabric Node SDK (and some other
dependencies probably) do not declare NodeJS v16 as a supported engine
(despite our tests succeeding on these) so we just do not have a choice
with this if we want to support NodeJS 16 (which we very much
do)

Also removes --ignore-engines parameter from the yarn install
command that the configure script runs so that the CI also verifies this
to be working fine.

                This script is now part of the ci.sh script which
ensures that there is no human error when defining
the webpack bundle names in the package.json files
for each package in the project.

The idea is to reduce the manual review burden on the
maintainers who can also miss these type of issues.

extensions do not contain common mistakes in them due to
typos or just forgetting to specify certain mandatory
properties.

Fixes #489

                It's been a common problem with people erasing review history
by opening new pull requests so now it's in the CONTRIBUTING.md
specifically being called out as something that's undesired.
