                This is a flaky test case that can't be reliably reproduce. I've ran the test individually 40 times and all 40 times it has passed successfully. 

This error, however, seems to pop up only when the `yarn jest` command is run (when I ran the test individually). 

Based on the linked ["hint"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50793885/referenceerror-you-are-trying-to-import-a-file-after-the-jest-environment-has/50793993#50793993) from the issue, it seems like using `jest.useFakeTimers()` a good solution. However, using the `jest.useFakeTimers()` with`async/await` was not recommended.

However, I found a [different source](https://gist.github.com/apieceofbart/e6dea8d884d29cf88cdb54ef14ddbcc4#file-test-js-L58) that showed examples of how to use the `jest.useFakeTimers()`. Our original problem, however, is probably because the after the test environment is torn down, the second test file is trying to import files from the first environment, triggering the error ([explained here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/11438#issuecomment-916711164)). So I've come to the solution of installing another node package: [node-cleanup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cleanup) and running that within the afterAll at the very end of the test. 

My laptop can't take running the `yarn jest` script too much so I haven't seen it reproduce the error yet. (WOT ruhrow)

                Our whitepaper, the first point of contact from enterprises and individuals alike, is very outdated (for more than two years, it received no updates).  An outdated whitepaper brings a lot of confusion to newcomers, as 1) it doesn' reflect updated work done on blockchain interoperability, 2) doesn't reflect the current status of the code, and 3) doesn't reflect future plans for the project

These problems have been and continue to hamper the adoption of Hyperledger Cacuts.

I'm putting together an effort to update the whitepaper, with an initial focus on the abstract, introduction, and theoretical models (non-formal) for interoperability (based on [our recent research](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Do_You_Need_a_Distributed_Ledger_Technology_Interoperability_Solution_/18786527/1)). 

I welcome all the blockchain interoperability and Hyperledger's communities to provide their feedback to this new version of the whitepaper.

Changes:

1. Updated abstract
2. Introduction now explains why do we need interoperability, Cactus, and how Cactus works
3. Section 2 now contains a robust model for interoperability. Some outdated information was refactored.
4. Updated references and recommended reference to the project (feel free to add yourself!)
