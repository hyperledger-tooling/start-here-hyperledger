                Probably there were never full merge `develop` -> `main`, that is why it is that hard to do its now (I tried: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/121). That is why instead of merge I'm just cherry-picking changes from `develop` to `main` branch.
_______
In `develop` branch was committed PR:
-------
1. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/104 - serious problem fixed with python files generated by too new `protobuf`
2. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/103 - small examples refactoring + added new example made by @iptelephony .
3. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/107 - serious refactoring of examples + added two more examples
4. Added auto-restart to iroha: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/122/commits/6781449d8081c0cdab80dc57a38f418734e109e1
______
In order to make its working in also Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 I needed to:
1. edit file: `setup.py` (requirements for versions only)
2. do the same as https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/104 but in Ubuntu 20.04 (but it also works in Ubuntu 22.04 now)
