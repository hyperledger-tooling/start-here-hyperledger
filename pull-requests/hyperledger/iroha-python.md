                Probably there were never full merge `develop` -> `main`, that is why it is that hard to do its now (I tried: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/121). That is why instead of merge I'm just cherry-picking changes from `develop` to `main` branch.
_______
In `develop` branch was committed PR:
-------
1. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/104 - serious problem fixed with python files generated by too new `protobuf`
2. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/103 - small examples refactoring + added new example made by @iptelephony .
3. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/107 - serious refactoring of examples + added two more examples
