                This is a continuation of #2307.

This updates the dependencies for the NodeJS wrapper, and makes some updates to the `indy.cc` to support newer node versions.

It works in the current (v16) and LTS (v14) as well as in older large/LTS node releases (v10, v12). However by doing this it drops support for Node v8 which reached its LTS end of life in 2019
