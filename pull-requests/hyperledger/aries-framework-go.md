                Additional validation when processing disclosures to assemble disclosed claims:

- If there is more than one place where the digest is included, the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.
- If the claim name already exists at the same level, the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.
- If the claim value contains an object with an _sdÂ key (at the top level or nested deeper), the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.

Closes #3519

            <td>
                Add interop tests for verifier - this is also to prove that we will not have issues with json libraries for interop (string hardening vs. canonicalization note in spec).

Since disclosures are created by the issuer the value can be influenced by marshalling (e.g. spaces, map order etc.) however it will not influence functionality since we are not supposed to re-create disclosures at any point.

Closes #3518
