                * KMS storage interface now uses a minimal interface instead of requiring a full Aries storage provider implementation (from the spi package)
* With this new approach, the consumer of an Aries KMS no longer has to let the Aries storage interface/implementation design dictate how they store KMS-related data. One notable example of this is that the choice of database name is now decided by the consumer rather than by Aries.
* To ease the transition, I added a function (NewAriesProviderWrapper) to allow a consumer to continue using an Aries storage provider implementation with a KMS if they wish. This method of injecting storage preserves the existing storage behaviour (e.g. Aries-controlled database naming).

**Summary:**

- `omitempty` tag for mandatory properties were removed
- optional properties (with the `omitempty` tag) of custom types were changed to pointers so they can be omitted with the `omitempty` tag
- additional validation checks which were missing and more unit tests
