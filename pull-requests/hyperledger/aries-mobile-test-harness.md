                This PR sets the selenium version to 4.9.0 since 4.9.1 caused driver not to instantiate in the test harness. This can be removed when 4.9.1 is fixed.

                This PR is for BC wallet tests. The Camera Policy page takes a long time to select Allow on iOS. Used the fastest find by routine (but still fairly long), hopefully that will be good enough. Revisit if not.
