                This PR removes the Onboarding skip functionality and testing from the BC Wallet regression tests. Skip has been removed from BC Wallet app. It is possible that the skip could re-emerge as functionality in BC Wallet so it is being left in the tests but commented out. If there comes a time in the future where we are sure Skip will not return, we will permanently remove the code.
