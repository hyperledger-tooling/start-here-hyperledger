                This PR stops BC Wallet scrolling for iOS when a cred offer or proof request comes in. With large credentials it takes a long time to scroll. iOS will find the element anyway even if it is not in the viewport, unlike Android where scrolling has to happen.

                The PR changes the ending of the security tests for BC Wallet which use to go ahead and change the environment to the test env. There is no need to do that in these tests, and saves minutes off of each test to remove it.
