This PR fixes BC Wallet test issues. One is access to the underlying page object is not accessible on android when a modal is displayed. This is different than on iOS. 

The other issue is On android the credential receiving takes longer than iOS, so a timeout increase was done. 

Another issue was @wip security tests were running because of double `Scenario` clauses on the tests.
