                This PR adds a new suite of BC Wallet tests that use the BC Showcase demo as issuers and verifiers.  

There is also a new run in the test pipeline for the showcase specific tests that will go to a separate Allure project for test results. 

There still needs to be some work on the Lawyer scenario, however I wanted to get this in to see if there was any issue running these in the nightly regression.
