                This PR calibrates the tests to the BC Wallet 1105 build where the "Home" page and associated labels have been change to "Notifications". 

It also fixes a revocation test where a testID has changes somewhere along the way and a locator by accessibility label is no longer working (a request has been logged in the bc wallet repo for a new testID).
