                Recently I've found that the members of the fabric-ja-jp-doc-maintainers team cannot merge the pull request for a Japanese document, which seems to be caused by the name changes for the i18n maintainers teams.

This patch fixes the CODEOWNERS file to point to the correct teams for each subdirectory for a language.
