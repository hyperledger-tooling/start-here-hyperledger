                Thank you for the contributions to the Japanese translation of the Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 documents!

Now that the translation for v2.2 has been completed, we are going to start the Japanese translation of the v2.5 documents.
First of all, this patch applies all updates done for the "release-2.2" branch to this "release-2.5" branch after it was created from the commit 7b4c10db so that we can start working on the "release-2.5" branch.
