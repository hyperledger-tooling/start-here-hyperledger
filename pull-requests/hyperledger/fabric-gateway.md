                Compatible change of Java Hash class to an enum since this allows hash algorithms to named following Java naming conventions as upper-case constants with underscores rather than as camel-case, which makes it much easier to distinguish SHA3 algorithms (for example, SHA3_256 rather than sha3256).

Closes #579
