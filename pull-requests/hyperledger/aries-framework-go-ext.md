                Title:
Adding sqlite to mobile agent

Description:
I created a component that allows a user to use a storage provider that connects with SQLite.

Summary:

Using https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go-ext/blob/main/component/storage/mysql/store.go as reference I created a store provider that connects with SQLite.
Also, I implemented the TotalItems() method inside the storage wrapper.

I'm making these changes from the conversation with @DRK3 [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pull/3306)

Thanks!
