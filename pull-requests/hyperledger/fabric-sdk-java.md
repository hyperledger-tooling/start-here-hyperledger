            <td>
                I have projects using [fabric-sdk-java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java) that also use opentelemetry at `1.12.0`, which clashes with the transitive dependency from here. Would appreciate if we can upgrade it to the latest version of 1.12.0. 

@bestbeforetoday could someone please help me figure out what went wrong with the build here?
