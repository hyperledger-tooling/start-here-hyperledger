                When following the instructions for installing indy for an Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) system, I found that the `brew install` command didn't work. After looking into how to install OpenSSL for M1, I found that the OpenSSL v1.1 on Homebrew also works for Apple Silicon chips (see: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openssl@1.1).

After following the rest of the instructions I ran the `is-indy-installed` test script, which resulted in `Libindy was installed correctly`. As a double check I have also installed `@aries-framework/node`, again with success.

> NOTE: When I ran `brew install openssl@1.1` it told me v1.1 was already on my system. I am unsure if this is because stuff I have installed prior to this attempt, or if this is because it's natively shipped with macOs. Therefore I have included the install command in the instructions, just to be sure.

I'm already using these changes in OOB implementation #531 but I wanted to create separate PR.
