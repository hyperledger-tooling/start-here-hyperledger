                Basic implementation of the missing Mediator role for Pick Up V2 protocol ([Aries RFC 0685](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0685-pickup-v2)). In order to make this PR smaller and non-breaking, not all features from protocol are supported, but only those used currently by `Recipient` implementation in AFJ 0.2.x. 

There are some refactoring here and there to start doing the split up suggested by #800, but attempting to maintain compatibility with current modules API.

Note that current implementation of client side assumes that the mediator will use a WebSocket connection, which is not actually mandatory. This behaviour is not yet updated, but might require to update `WsInboundTransporter` to manage long-term WebSockets connections (e.g. use a heartbeat interval mechanism) in order to be really useful.

Solves #956 and hopefully #475 and #727.

                Implementation of module fully supporting [Aries RFC 0509](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0509-action-menu/README.md) for both `requester` and `responder` roles.

Protocol states and information are stored in records of type `ActionMenuRecord`. As this protocol currently defines a single active menu per connection, there will be at most 2 records per connection (as theoretically is possible to serve as requester and responder at the same time). While this information could be stored also in Connection Metadata, specific records were created thinking in a future version/extension of this protocol where multiple menus could be deployed (e.g. a menu by thread).

Still plenty of tests to do and fixes/support for error messages, as well as check compatibility with ACA-Py implementation.

                As exemplified in [Aries RFC 0008](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading#nested-example), there are certain situations where proofs must be exchanged as part of an inner flow, such as a credential issuance.

This PR attempts to support launching a Present Proof V1 protocol as a sub-protocol from another one, without impacting current Agent behaviour and API (apart from adding some fields and methods). It does not, however, add support for all threading concepts (such as `sender_order` and `receiver_order`), as it might introduce breaking changes and also needs to be more carefully designed.
