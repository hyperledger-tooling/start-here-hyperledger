            <td>
                When a message for a connection request (either for DID Exchange or Connection protocol) is received, a session is created without any connection id associated to it (as it is not created yet).

If the party requesting a connection does not have a public endpoint (e.g. a edge agent connecting to a mediator) and the responder does not have `autoAcceptConnections` enabled, it will not associate this session to the newly created connection, forcing any call to `agent.connections.acceptRequest` to queue the messages, even if the transport used allows a persistent connection (typical case for WebSockets).

So here what we do is simply to associate the connection to the session as soon as it is created. At the moment I don't see any drawback of this strategy but will be happy to hear any situation where this could represent a problem.

                This is something we are using to keep track of the actual id of messages related to `BasicMessageRecord` and to provide a way to relate a message to another (or another ones), giving the possibility of doing a sort of `message reply` without actually defining a new protocol but using an intrinsic feature of DIDComm messaging.

I'd like to refactor `basic-messages` module to align with others (such as `proofs` and `discover-features`) and to make it adaptable to V2 protocol, but didn't want to introduce more breaking changes before releasing 0.4.0, so I simply added `parentThreadId` as an optional parameter for now.

                Add support for wallet export and import by copying sqlite file and executing a key rotation to the one specified in the `WalletExportImportConfig` object. Similarly, when importing the wallet it will copy the origin file to the expected directory according to wallet id and do a rekey to the key specified.

In addition, there are a few tweaks and fixes for things I found during testing such as: 

- Key object handles clearing in pack/unpack and key creation/signing/verification methods
- Check wallet database file is created before (not sure why, but Askar is not throwing Duplicate error in `Store.provision` when wallet exists). This only works for SQLite but it's better than nothing
- Use key derivation based in argon2 Int if nothing specified, as it's the default in Indy SDK AFAIK

                Adds `useLegacyProverDid` flag for credential request creation, which is always set when dealing with legacy indy identifiers. Some checks were added in `LegacyIndyCredentialFormatService` to make sure we are using legacy ones.

When using IndySdk, only legacy prover_did can be used, while in AnonCredsRs through this flag we can select between prover_did and entropy, unless we are using new identifiers where only entropy can be generated.

This currently makes break a test in anoncreds-rs package because it seems that, in the underlying library, entropy is required even if passing legacy identifiers.

Depends on a fix for entropy handling in `anoncreds-rs` (to be released in v0.1.0-dev10)
