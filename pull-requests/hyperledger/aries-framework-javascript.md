                Disallow usage of global `Buffer`, require it to be imported. `Buffer` is available globally in Node.JS and I can't seem to make TS think we're not in a NodeJS env. I just discovered this eslint rule that takes care of it (and also fixed one usage of global buffer outside of the tests ðŸŽ‰ )
