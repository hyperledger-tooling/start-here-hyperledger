                This PR marks the first iteration to propose a list of labels with prefix and the high level process of triage. 

Once reviewed, the labels will be created accordingly. We could create them in Identus repository to make a PoC as well (thus seeing how it looks like and it could also help to define the colours of the labels as well).
