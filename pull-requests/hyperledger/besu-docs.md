                There are some issues related to using "londonBlock" in free gas private networks:
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4053
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4061

This PR is a quick fix ahead of the london issues getting resolved, after which we will be able to document how to use free gas with london properly.

I am proposing using the milestone before london: "berlinBlock" so that the latest opcodes are used but the complications around london aren't introduced.
