<blockquote>
<h2>Changed value for the insecure setting</h2>
<p>The default value for the <code>insecure</code> setting, which disables the check of SSL certificates, has been changed from <code>&quot;False&quot;</code> to <code>False</code> (its now a boolean value).
This does not change the behavior of the settings, but it's more compliant with the <code>session.request</code> option.
See <a href="https://redirect.github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown/issues/86">#86</a> more more details.</p>
