  Here is [the list of changes Roland recently made](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Arolandtyler).
- [x] The proposed maintainer has the sponsorship of at least one other maintainer.
    - [x] This sponsoring maintainer will create a PR modifying the list of maintainers. **-> that's me**
    - [x] The proposed maintainer accepts the nomination and expresses a willingness to be a long-term (more than 6 months) committer.
    - [x] This would be a comment in the above PR. **@rolandtyler can you comment on this PR to accept please?**
- [x] This PR will be communicated in all appropriate communication channels.
      It should be mentioned in any maintainer/community call.
      It should also be posted to the appropriate mailing list or chat channels if they exist.
      **See Hyperledger [RocketChat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors) and [mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/besu)**
- [x] Approval by at least 3 current maintainers within two weeks **(until 2021, September 17)** of the proposal,
- [ ] or an absolute majority of current maintainers.
    - These votes will be recorded as review approval, comments or 👍 in the PR modifying the list of maintainers.
- [ ] No veto by another maintainer within two weeks of proposal are recorded **(until 2021, September 17)**.

    - Or an absolute majority of maintainers approve.
