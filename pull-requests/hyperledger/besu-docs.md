                ## Describe the change

Using environment variable for config file does not work.
Based on personal experience and some code research.
Please check the file:
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/besu/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/cli/util/ConfigOptionSearchAndRunHandler.java#L63

**This does not read config.toml**
`BESU_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.toml besu `

**This works well**
`besu --config-file=/path/to/config.toml`
