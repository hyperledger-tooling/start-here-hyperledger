                ... also removes the last vestige of a dependency on FF Core ðŸª¶ 

Updates the reply processing to emit all updates - note that FF core will need to process a new `header.type` of `TransactionUpdate` (as well as `TransactionFailure` and `TransactionSuccess`).

                I realized that there was a gap in the ordering logic, in the case that there is a number of pending event waiting confirmation and we go through and do `walkChain()`.

Specifically if new blocks become available during that cycle, we might get a "hit" for a block for a later event, which was a "miss" for that block for an earlier event - simply because the block has just been mined.

So I've added a `blockState` that is created each time we do a cycle, that ensures we don't change answers on ourselves for the duration of that cycle.
