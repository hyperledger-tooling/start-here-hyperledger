<blockquote>
<h2>v2.32.0</h2>
<h2>2.32.0 (2024-05-20)</h2>
<h2>üêç PYCON US 2024 EDITION üêç</h2>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where setting <code>verify=False</code> on the first request from a
Session will cause subsequent requests to the <em>same origin</em> to also ignore
cert verification, regardless of the value of <code>verify</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56">https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>verify=True</code> now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6667">#6667</a>)</li>
<li>Requests now supports optional use of character detection
(<code>chardet</code> or <code>charset_normalizer</code>) when repackaged or vendored.
This enables <code>pip</code> and other projects to minimize their vendoring
surface area. The <code>Response.text()</code> and <code>apparent_encoding</code> APIs
will default to <code>utf-8</code> if neither library is present. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6702">#6702</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
calculated in the request content-length. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6589">#6589</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6629">#6629</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed bug where an extra leading <code>/</code> (path separator) could lead
urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6644">#6644</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6503">#6503</a>)</li>
<li>Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6641">#6641</a>)</li>
<li>Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6642">#6642</a>)</li>
<li>Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6641">#6641</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various typo fixes and doc improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.
The source files for the projects (formerly <code>requests</code>) is now located
in <code>src/requests</code> in the Requests sdist. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6506">#6506</a>)</li>
<li>Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system
using <code>hatchling</code>. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old
versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.</li>
