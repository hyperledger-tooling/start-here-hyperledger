                #### Type of change

- Documentation update

#### Description

The `-d` flag is used by default in test/demo materials such as hyperledger/fabric-samples, so having the the flag be hidden from the documentation causes confusion. Remove 'hide'; add a warning for why users might not want to use it, since those drawbacks were probably the primary reason it was hidden before.
