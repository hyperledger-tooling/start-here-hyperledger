#### Type of change

- New feature

#### Description

Builds the CA docker image as a multi-stage build, `FROM ubuntu:20.04`. 

With this PR, the base image used to build the CA is now extended from ubuntu.  This resolves several issues related to the golang-alpine base image, which frequently threw SIGSEGV errors when running or linking against the musl libc runtime.  The fabric binaries generated by this build are _dynamically_ linked against the ubuntu / GCC libc, using CGO for the sqlite runtime.
