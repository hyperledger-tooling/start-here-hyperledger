#### Type of change

- Bug fix

#### Description

In PR #346, the CA base docker image was switched from alpine-golang to ubuntu.  In the new image, golang is now installed with curl using the `GO_VER`, `TARGETOS`, AND `TARGETARCH` build args.

Depending on the version of Docker installed on the build host, `TARGETOS` and `TARGETARCH` are not always available in the build context.  (In recent Docker versions, these args are implicit in the build context.)  For instance, the fabric-interop tests at Azure are currently failing when trying to build a CA docker image. 

This PR passes the target arch/os from the Makefile to docker as build args.

#### Type of change

- New feature

#### Description

Builds the CA docker image as a multi-stage build, `FROM ubuntu:20.04`. 

With this PR, the base image used to build the CA is now extended from ubuntu.  This resolves several issues related to the golang-alpine base image, which frequently threw SIGSEGV errors when running or linking against the musl libc runtime.  The fabric binaries generated by this build are _dynamically_ linked against the ubuntu / GCC libc, using CGO for the sqlite runtime.
