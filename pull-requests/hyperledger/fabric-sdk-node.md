                ts-scenario tests failed with Node 16 and 18 only, with the following error:

TSError: тип Unable to compile TypeScript:
error TS6046: Argument for '--module' option must be: 'none', 'commonjs', 'amd', 'system', 'umd', 'es6', 'es2015', 'es2020', 'esnext'.

ts-node was not correctly identifying the tsconfig.json for the ts-scenario tests and using some default values.

Fix by avoiding transpile altogether, which should also provide some performance benefits. Instead compile the ts-scenario code using the TypeScript compiler, and run cucumber-js on the compiled output.

                While testing the `fabric-node-SDK`, found that the connections were not getting reused creating more connections in the pool. 

While debugging the issue further found that the issue is the connection was not getting destroyed. The `request.abort()` method was deprecated for a really long time too, so it makes sense this could be changed. 

Thus, this minor code change fixes this issue and we're able to decrease the number of active GRPC connections on the network.
