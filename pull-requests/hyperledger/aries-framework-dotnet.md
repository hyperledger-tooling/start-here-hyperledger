                #### Short description of what this resolves:
Mime-type for issued credentials was hard coded in UpdateValues() to text/plain, which caused every credential in the wallet to have text/plain as the mimetype. This PR resolves that issue.

#### Changes proposed in this pull request:

Changed UpdateValues() in DefaultCredentialHandler
