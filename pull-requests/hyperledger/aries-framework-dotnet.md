#### Short description of what this resolves:
There are some references in the repo to the old "streetcred-id" GitHub organization that need to be changed to "trinsic-id".  Another party has grabbed the "streetcred-id" github account and is using it, so the links are no longer reliable.

#### Changes proposed in this pull request:

- Rename several paths into GitHub to use Trinsic
