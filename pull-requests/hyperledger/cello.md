<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases">jinja2's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.11.3</h2>
<p>This contains a fix for a speed issue with the <code>urlize</code> filter. <code>urlize</code> is likely to be called on untrusted user input. For certain inputs some of the regular expressions used to parse the text could take a very long time due to backtracking. As part of the fix, the email matching became slightly stricter. The various speedups apply to <code>urlize</code> in general, not just the specific input cases.</p>

<h2>Version 2.11.3</h2>
<p>Released 2021-01-31</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the speed of the <code>urlize</code> filter by reducing regex
backtracking. Email matching requires a word character at the start
of the domain part, and only word characters in the TLD. :pr:<code>1343</code></li>
