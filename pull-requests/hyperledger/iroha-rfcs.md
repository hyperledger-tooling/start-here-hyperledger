                This PR introduces several aspects to the Configuration Overhaul RFC (#3) that were previously overlooked:

- The presence of configuration endpoints
- The existence of configuration-related Iroha Special Instructions (ISIs)
- The potential extension of RFC proposals to other tools related to Iroha, specifically the Iroha Client CLI
- The mechanism for resolving relative paths

For detailed insights, please refer to the PR's diff. These enhancements are part of the continued effort to refine and simplify Iroha's configuration process for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
