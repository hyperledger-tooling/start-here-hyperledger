                We utilize this file to reconstruct the Aries Bifold ledgers during the build process. In response to the discussion found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-networks/issues/3), we are incorporating the addition of "namespaces" to the ledgers. This update integrates the modifications discussed in that conversation into this file, ensuring its continued use in Aries Bifold.
