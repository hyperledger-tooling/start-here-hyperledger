- isolating mobile app boilerplate in its own folder: This is effective a minimal template of a what a bifold-based app would need to have
   - move files from `android` to `bifold-app/android`
   - move files from `ios` to `bifold-app/ios`
   - move `index.js` to `bifold-app/index.js`
   - move `App.tsx` to `bifold-app/App.tsx`
- introduce configuration Context
-  move all `dependencies` to `peerDepedencies`: This might need to be revisited in the future. Most of react native dependencies only works if it is a direct dependency of the project.
- add react-native-builder-bob for packaging as a library
- Change to Github action to reflect the folder changes

# TODO

- [ ] Remove `yarn.lock` file
- [ ] Fix native build action in the next PR

I/We were able to remove Snyk's access to the project so it can no longer create PRs. This change makes the `.snyk` file redundant.
