# Summary of Changes

This PR adds a new uiConfig file to the core/configs directory. By default, this PR shouldn't change the app at all. If the flags are switched though, users are able to configure the app to use 5 tabs instead of 3, navigate to the chat screen upon a connection being made instead of waiting for a notification to come through, hide the tab labels, use the QR display screen, or remove the highlight circle around the Scan tab.
