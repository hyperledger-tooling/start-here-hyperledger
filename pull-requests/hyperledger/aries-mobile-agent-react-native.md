This PR introduces style changes to accommodate a11y features such as zoomed displays. Various screens now incorporate ScrollViews in the event content runs off the screen. Buttons are now, by standard, fixed to the bottom of screens (which should allow for refactoring screens into a common form component). Test snapshots have been updated accordingly.

This PR adds a patch to the AFJ Agent provider extension to eliminate having to pass the agent by props in the component tree. It exposes a setter method instead. Eventually this should replace the implementation in the AFJ Extensions. This fixes an issue that recently emerged in the Splash screen with the refactor of the app initialization. The Splash screen needs to be able to set the agent on initialization but cannot receive state function via props since it is customizable via configuration therefore the component signature cannot be enforced.
