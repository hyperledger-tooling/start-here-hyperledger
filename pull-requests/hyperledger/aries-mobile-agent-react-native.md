# Summary of Changes

When trying to compile the android application (running `npm run android` or `./gradlew assembleRelease` in app/android folder), the compilation crashes. This is a known error, which has a fix describe in [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/35210). I just applied the fix mentioned in the issue link, and the compilation works fine.

<h2>0.7.7</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/0.7.6...0.7.7">Commits</a></p>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Security: Prevent inserting DOM nodes when they are not well-formed <a href="https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883"><code>CVE-2022-39353</code></a>
In case such a DOM would be created, the part that is not well-formed will be transformed into text nodes, in which xml specific characters like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are encoded accordingly.
In the upcoming version 0.9.0 those text nodes will no longer be added and an error will be thrown instead.
This change can break your code, if you relied on this behavior, e.g. multiple root elements in the past. We consider it more important to align with the specs that we want to be aligned with, considering the potential security issues that might derive from people not being aware of the difference in behavior.
