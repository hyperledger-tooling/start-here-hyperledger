                # Summary of Changes

This new simplified rendering strat relies on [Flexbox Layout](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) and automatically image scaling. As part of this automatic scaling the logo images MUST be provided in a predefined aspect ratio: 1:1  (width:height) for logos that shows issuer name, or `4:1` (width:height) for when the issuer name is hidden.

<p><strong>Only use HTML rules if mimeType matches</strong> <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmldom/xmldom/pull/338"><code>[#338](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/338)</code></a>, fixes <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/203"><code>[#203](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/203)</code></a></p>
<p>In the living specs for parsing XML and HTML, that this library is trying to implement,
there is a distinction between the different types of documents being parsed:
There are quite some rules that are different for parsing, constructing and serializing XML vs HTML documents.</p>
<p>So far xmldom was always &quot;detecting&quot; whether &quot;the HTML rules should be applied&quot; by looking at the current namespace. So from the first time an the HTML default namespace (<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>) was found, every node was treated as being part of an HTML document. This misconception is the root cause for quite some reported bugs.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: HTML rules are no longer applied just because of the namespace, but require the <code>mimeType</code> argument passed to <code>DOMParser.parseFromString(source, mimeType)</code> to match <code>'text/html'</code>. Doing so implies all rules for handling casing for tag and attribute names when parsing, creation of nodes and searching nodes.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: Correct the return type of <code>DOMParser.parseFromString</code> to <code>Document | undefined</code>. In case of parsing errors it was always possible that &quot;the returned <code>Document</code>&quot; has not been created. In case you are using Typescript you now need to handle those cases.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: The instance property <code>DOMParser.options</code> is no longer available, instead use the individual <code>readonly</code> property per option (<code>assign</code>, <code>domHandler</code>, <code>errorHandler</code>, <code>normalizeLineEndings</code>, <code>locator</code>, <code>xmlns</code>). Those also provides the default value if the option was not passed. The 'locator' option is now just a boolean (default remains <code>true</code>).</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: The following methods no longer allow a (non spec compliant) boolean argument to toggle &quot;HTML rules&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>XMLSerializer.serializeToString</code></li>
<li><code>Node.toString</code></li>
</ul>
