Added status bar background to IOS. IOS doesn't really have a notion of status bar background colour, the IOS status bar is always transparent. I added a simple view at the top of the modal to give the effect of a coloured status bar. I added the component to the usebiometry in the settings as well as the camera disclosure modal

Previously the toasts that let the user know a credential or contact had been removed were being covered by the common remove modal. This PR addresses that. It's not a perfect fix but since we're looking at swapping toasts out entirely, it'll do for now.

Here's what it looks like:

Auto-accept lerna prompts so it can run in a CICD pipeline. Was disable for the first run so I could see what it wanted to publish. LGTM.

Use lerna to publish `@hyperledger/aries-oca` package with an `alpha` tag with the versioning pattern denoted below. A alpha release will be triggered manually by `workflow_dispatch`.

- 1.0.0-alpha.1
- 1.0.0-alpha.2
- 1.0.0-alpha.3
- ...

Package versions can be incremented by updating the repo tag and version in the `learna.json` file. To reset to a specific version this command can do it for all publishable packages:

```console
npx lerna version 0.0.0 --signoff-git-commit --sign-git-commit --no-private
```

It will create a commit tag `v0.0.0` in this case with the git command `git tag v0.0.0 -m "v0.0.0"` the `-m` option is important (ask me how I know). Without it, the tag will not be recognized. This tag cam be moved around with `git tag v0.0.0 -m "v0.0.0" SHA256` as needed.

To see what lerna will do for the next publication version run:

```console
npx lerna publish --no-private --loglevel=verbose --canary "major" --dist-tag alpha --force-publish
```

Adjust the `--canary "major"` option as needed.

Previously if the photo attribute was blank in any credential field, the user would receive a warning.
I've changed the functionality so that if the photo is blank then it will display as an empty text field instead.

Previously declining a proof request would cause Bifold to attempt to send a problem report even if the proof request was connectionless, which caused an error. This PR conditionally sends problem reports only if there is a connection.

# Pull Request Checklist

Tick all boxes below to demonstrate that you have completed the respective task. If the item does not apply to your this PR **check it anyway** to make it apparent that there's nothing to do.

- [X] All commits contain a DCO `Signed-off-by` line (we use the [DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce this);
- [X] Updated LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.md for any added dependencies or vendored components;
- [X] Updated documentation as needed for changed code and new or modified features;
- [X] Added sufficient [tests](../__tests__/) so that overall code coverage is not reduced.

If you have _any_ questions to _any_ of the points above, just **submit and ask**! This checklist is here to _help_ you, not to deter you from contributing!

Pro Tip 🤓

- Read our [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at least once; it will save you a few review cycles!
- Your PR will likely not be reviewed until all the above boxes are checked and all automated tests have passed.
