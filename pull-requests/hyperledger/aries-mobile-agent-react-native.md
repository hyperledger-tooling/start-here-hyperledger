I've added the animation to indicate a credential was successfully added to the wallet. I'm going to do a 2nd PR to cleanup the transitions between state. I think there are places where I choose to render the View where I should be choosing what Text to show. This causes things to jump around in the UI a bit. Its beyond the scope of this PR which is why its not included now.
