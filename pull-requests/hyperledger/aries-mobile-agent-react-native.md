Previously the credential offer and detail screen would display all credential attributes. I changed the functionality so that if the oca branding has the `attributes` attribute then it will only display the attributes listed in the oca bundle. otherwise it will display all attributes

Previously if the user was using a language that didn't have an OCA branding entry then nothing would be displayed on the credential card where the issuer name and credential name should be. I changed the functionality to fall back to using the first language in the overlay if the user's language isn't supported in the overlay
