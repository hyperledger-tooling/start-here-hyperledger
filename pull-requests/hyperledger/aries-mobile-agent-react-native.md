Disabling going back function on connectionless proof flow.

### Expected behavior
Users should not exit this screen using the device's back button, just the home icon.

### Actual behavior
Users can go back and on android it shows up a black screen, on iOS returns to the scan screen.

### To fix
I added `gestureEnabled` for ios (didn't work on android) and `Backhandler API` for android, both already used in the project.
