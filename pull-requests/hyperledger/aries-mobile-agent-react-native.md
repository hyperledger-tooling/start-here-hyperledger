AFJ 0.2.x removed attributes from credential exchange record when in an offer state. The attributes are now retrieved from the `getFormatData` method and displayed accordingly. Schema ID and Credential Definition ID are loaded into the credential exchange record metadata for credential card component to display credential title.

As per Google's policy we need to disclose why the camera is bing used and what happens to any data captured by it. This adds a screen that is displayed prior to the camera being activated. Once the user dismisses the screen, it will not show again. Following this screen the OS can do any permission requests.
