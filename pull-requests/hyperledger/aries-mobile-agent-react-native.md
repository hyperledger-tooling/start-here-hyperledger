                # Summary of Changes

Previously if the wallet timeout was reached and the user was locket out, it wouldn't close the wallet. This resulted in the mobile verifier feature not working, the loading screen would hang on the presenter side and they would never receive a proof request. I added functionality to close the wallet on a timeout and it seems to have resolved the issue.

Sheldon asked for Unverified Person templates for ease of testing, Decided to make them development only templates so they don't end up in prod.
- Added extra toggle on developer menu to include development templates
- Bound inputs so that when the dev templates toggle is on, verifier feature must be enabled. Conversely when the verifier feature is turned off, dev template must also be turned off

When the proof request contains more than ten attributes, the card keep blinking. This happens because the `initialNumToRender` variable has a default value of ten.

Previously the notification functionality was listing any proof record that was in the done state. This doesn't really make sense since the notification list is supposed to contain proofs and credential offers that haven't been completed yet. The functionality to list completed proof requests in the notification list has been removed

Previously, if an older instance of the wallet that had already gone through onboarding was initialized it would have an undefined walletName in preferences, which would then overwrite the default value. This caused errors in connections because the label was missing. This fix is two-pronged, first it will convert undefined `walletName` values in localstorage to `generateRandomWalletName` when preferences are loaded, then it will use a backup value of `Aries Bifold` if `walletName` is still somehow undefined.

EDIT: I also removed the check for the wallet being named from the onboarding completeness check, so that older already-initialized wallets don't end up having to go back to onboarding. (Something I did for BC Wallet already but not for Bifold)
