This PR fixes the deeplink error issue sometimes caused by other apps linking into Bifold / BC Wallet without params. The RootStack component is quite difficult to set up for unit / integration testing and it's a small change so I'm hoping we can slide this one by without, given the urgency.

Each workspace package have it own package.json file. To avoid dependency conflict and unnecessary nested dependencies, I've aligned the dependency across all packages.

[syncpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpack) is a nice utility that can be run on a regular basis to keep the dependency aligned.
