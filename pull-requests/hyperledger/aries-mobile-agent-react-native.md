# Summary of Changes

The GENESIS_URL env variable seems to be not used at the moment. So i added the functionality for loading the genesis file and adding it to the indy ledgers.

I was not sure about making the ledger from the env a production ledger or not.

Maybe a json file with the format of 
`[{"name": "BCovrinTest", "isProduction": false, "genesisTransactions": ...}]`
would be more configurable then having default ledgers and adding one with the env file.

Feedback and other ideas appreciated.
