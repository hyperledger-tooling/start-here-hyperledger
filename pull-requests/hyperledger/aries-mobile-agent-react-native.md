                # Summary of Changes

As noted [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/36758) there is a problem with the Yoga package in RN building with Xcode 14.3. This is a temporary work around to peg the build to 14.2 until this issue can be resolved more thoroughly.

- Some adjustments were made on theme to better handle modal screens when those have backgroundColor different from the other screens.
- Static SVGs where moved to the theme, allowing to customize those images
- Animated components where moved to a new provider, so it can be customized as well. The reason I didn't use the theme for this customization is that some of those components use themed styles (it would have a cyclic dependency).

Configures initial publishing processes to be able to manually release versions as well as does some refinement of the build config using TS. Draws on some configurations/structures used in AFJ. Used to manually release https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-bifold/oca & https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-bifold/core

Also sets up a basic react native package with native modules for the new Core package. This _should_ put the OCA package in a place that we can get the OCA resolver code moved over and published for use.

@cvarjao will be happy to note that I _think_ we may be able to do yarn 3 and lerna, so we may not have to downgrade to yarn 1 (but we can revisit if needed in the future). 

I don't expect this PR to impact anything in the legacy core/app, but please let me know if it does cause any issues @bryce-mcmath (the most likely thing to impact it is the changes I made to the ./tsconfig.json).

Checks if reaching the connection timer the connection is ready and no offer/proof is available (otherwise, it will go home right after the offer/proof is shown).
I also added a non-required configuration to override the current timer of 10000 ms. Be aware that if the timer is too short, the connection might not be active yet.
