In attempt to make the code more maintainable and encourage the public to collaborate, a logger service is important to trace major app flow and/or errors in the app, similar to AFJ
Thus is the service file only, following PR will wire up the service with a provider to use the logger anywhere in the App

# Summary of Changes

Previously on the UseBiometrics page, during on-boarding, the agent initialisation would start as soon as the user visited the page. This made the buttons unresponsive for a few seconds while the agent was loading. In addition it would try to navigate to the tabstack as soon as the agent was initialised. Since the tabstack is not available on the biometrics screen, if the user stayed on the biometrics screen for the 10-ish seconds that it takes for the agent to initialise, then the navigation to the tabstack would fail, and the user would be stuck on the splash screen once they pressed the `Continue` button.

This change resolves the issue by making the agent initialisation happen after the user presses continue on the biometrics screen.

The latest initialisation changes caused the connection with the mediator to not be saved. This meant that once logged in, the user couldn't form connections with any issuers/verifiers. I resolved this issue by calling `setAgent` once the agent had been initialised

Authenticate user by unlocking the wallet. Remove pin hash from storage if user isn't using biometrics. This functionality also allows a user to decline biometrics and fall back to PIN.

Some tests needed to be skipped since whenever there was a call to open the wallet, the jest framework would complain during testing.
