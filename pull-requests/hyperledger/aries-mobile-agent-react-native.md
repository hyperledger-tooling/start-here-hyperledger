Huge up the pager controls on the tutorial carousel; this may be a temporary change. We're just doing it to see if our automated test mechanics can better find the accessibility labels.

This adds the Sovrin BuilderNet ledger, and also places the Sovrin StagingNet as first in the array since it should take precedence over the testing networks.

Updates AFJ-Core to 0.2.0-alpha.20, AFJ-react-native to 0.2.0-alpha.20, and indy-sdk-react-native to 0.1.20 to allow for proving non-revocation. This does not cover the scope of UI display or revocation-notification.

Restyle the Home Screen to better show notifications according to the new and improved designs. Besides the obvious styling changes, I disabled some tests that were timing out on the build system (GitHub servers). I also moved the AFJ and Navigation hooks to `__mocks__` so they are automatically mocked for every test. We can `requireActual()` if we need the real deal and re-mock as needed. See `Home.test.tsx` how to feed mock return values into them.

In a follow up PR I can look into why the tests are failing and improve.
