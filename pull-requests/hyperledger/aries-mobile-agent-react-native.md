                # Summary of Changes

During the testing of the maximum possible number of requested attributes that can be set in a proof request, I noticed that generated request message does not actually contain the attribute restrictions (schema_id) we defined in the request template. 
It happens that AFJ requires the building of a special custom data type for passing indy proof request restrictions otherwise they are just ignored.

Issue: The logic of getting the proof request template was incorrect because the function searched for the request in the default constant. Instead, it must search in the application configuration, so if the app overrides the templates the proper one will be found.
