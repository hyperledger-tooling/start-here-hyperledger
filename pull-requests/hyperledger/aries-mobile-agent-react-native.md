- Add Theme provider
- Fixed lintstagedrc to run using npx so that there is no need to have dependencies installed globally (e.: json, tsx, typescript)
- Removed import aliasing (`components`)
- Added `typecheck` script so that we can use for typescript validation (`npm run typecheck`)

Updated the pull request template:

- I removed the box for running the linter. Its an automated task and I just noted that the PR won't be reviewed until all automated tests / tasks run successfully.
- I added a check box to indicate that sufficient tests have been added so that code coverage is not reduced.
