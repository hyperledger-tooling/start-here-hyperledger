This PR adds a new uiConfig file to the core/configs directory. By default, this PR shouldn't change any of the base functionality of the app. If the flags are switched though, users are able to configure the app to use 5 tabs instead of 3, navigate to the chat screen upon a connection being made instead of waiting for a notification to come through, hide the tab labels, use the QR display screen, or remove the highlight circle around the Scan tab.
