# Summary of Changes

Fixed biometrics for android onboarding and login. Previously the user on android would be prompted for biometrics once at the pin create screen, and once or twice at the biometrics screen (even if they selected to not use biometrics). At the login the user would previously have to enter their pin and then authenticate with biometrics (even if they selected to not use biometrics durin onboarding). With the new update the user is never prompted for biometrics unless they select it on the onboarding screen, in which case they are only prompted at the biometrics screen and whenever they login to the app.
