AFJ 0.2.x removed attributes from credential exchange record when in an offer state. The attributes are now retrieved from the `getFormatData` method and displayed accordingly. Schema ID and Credential Definition ID are loaded into the credential exchange record metadata for credential card component to display credential title.
