This PR adds a patch to the AFJ Agent provider extension to eliminate having to pass the agent by props in the component tree. It exposes a setter method instead. Eventually this should replace the implementation in the AFJ Extensions. This fixes an issue that recently emerged in the Splash screen with the refactor of the app initialization. The Splash screen needs to be able to set the agent on initialization but cannot receive state function via props since it is customizable via configuration therefore the component signature cannot be enforced.
