iOS 14+ uses local network permissions at app start which triggers permissions package to start, incorrectly configured Podfile and outdated package version cause an exception trigger at iOS app startup
Updated `react-native-permissions` package and added configuration in Podfile
Also tested Android to make sure updating package doesn't affect the flow

If a proof is not in the request-received state then it will error out when sending. I've added functionality to disable the share button if a proof is not in the request received state

Disabling going back function on connectionless proof flow.

### Expected behavior
Users should not exit this screen using the device's back button, just the home icon.

### Actual behavior
Users can go back and on android it shows up a black screen, on iOS returns to the scan screen.

### To fix
I added `gestureEnabled` for ios (didn't work on android) and `Backhandler API` for android, both already used in the project.
