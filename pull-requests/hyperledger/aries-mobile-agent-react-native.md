# Summary of Changes

This PR removes the old management of revocation notification using the context providers and instead uses the new AFJ and react hook functionality to detect if a credential is revoked. Once a credential is revoked, a new notification will appear on the Home screen. If the credential details is viewed for the revoked credential it will add a metadata property to get rid of the notification. 

It should be noted that the "CredentialRevokedMessageTitle" was edited and a new string was added to the English localization file. Please let me know if anyone has suggestions on how to avoid these changes or update the other translation files to match.

This change enables connections using a url shortener request (see [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0434-outofband#url-shortening](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0434-outofband#url-shortening)).
To receive invites using a url shortener, I changed the call `agent?.oob.parseInvitation(uri)` to `agent?.oob.parseInvitationShortUrl(uri)`. They are basically the same, but the second one also has support to short urls.

                # Summary of Changes

The list of export items in `core/App/index.ts` is rapidly growing. I am proposing that we switch to export "namespaced" objects for better organization.

This PR does not remove any existing exports, so it doesn't break compatibility. Removal of the exports would be a breaking change that can be introduced later.

This new simplified rendering strat relies on [Flexbox Layout](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) and automatically image scaling. As part of this automatic scaling the logo images MUST be provided in a predefined aspect ratio: 1:1  (width:height) for logos that shows issuer name, or `4:1` (width:height) for when the issuer name is hidden.

<p><strong>Only use HTML rules if mimeType matches</strong> <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmldom/xmldom/pull/338"><code>[#338](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/338)</code></a>, fixes <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/203"><code>[#203](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/203)</code></a></p>
<p>In the living specs for parsing XML and HTML, that this library is trying to implement,
there is a distinction between the different types of documents being parsed:
There are quite some rules that are different for parsing, constructing and serializing XML vs HTML documents.</p>
<p>So far xmldom was always &quot;detecting&quot; whether &quot;the HTML rules should be applied&quot; by looking at the current namespace. So from the first time an the HTML default namespace (<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>) was found, every node was treated as being part of an HTML document. This misconception is the root cause for quite some reported bugs.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: HTML rules are no longer applied just because of the namespace, but require the <code>mimeType</code> argument passed to <code>DOMParser.parseFromString(source, mimeType)</code> to match <code>'text/html'</code>. Doing so implies all rules for handling casing for tag and attribute names when parsing, creation of nodes and searching nodes.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: Correct the return type of <code>DOMParser.parseFromString</code> to <code>Document | undefined</code>. In case of parsing errors it was always possible that &quot;the returned <code>Document</code>&quot; has not been created. In case you are using Typescript you now need to handle those cases.</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: The instance property <code>DOMParser.options</code> is no longer available, instead use the individual <code>readonly</code> property per option (<code>assign</code>, <code>domHandler</code>, <code>errorHandler</code>, <code>normalizeLineEndings</code>, <code>locator</code>, <code>xmlns</code>). Those also provides the default value if the option was not passed. The 'locator' option is now just a boolean (default remains <code>true</code>).</p>
<p>BREAKING CHANGE: The following methods no longer allow a (non spec compliant) boolean argument to toggle &quot;HTML rules&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>XMLSerializer.serializeToString</code></li>
<li><code>Node.toString</code></li>
</ul>
