previously, the credential card would display the name of the proof request group on the proof request screen. Changed the functionality to display the credential name instead. still defaults to using the proof group name if the credential isn't found

Sometimes when processing a deeplink the `isDeeplinkActive` state wouldn't be cleared. This could cause certain screen to be inaccessible because the wallet would think it's still processing a deeplink and would redirect to user to the home screen to handle the deeplink.

I changed the deeplink handler to be in the rootstack so that the wallet doesn't have to redirect the user to home in order to process a deeplink.

Refactored `NotificationListItem` to handle the different styling types (error, success, info, warn) and change revocation notifications to use the error type. Also fixed the i18n for `NewRevoked`

Here's what it looks like:
