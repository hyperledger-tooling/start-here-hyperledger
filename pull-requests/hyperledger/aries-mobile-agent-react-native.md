Add support for connection alias, connection label, and a fallback to `Unknown` for issuer names (so we don't end up using their `connectionId` so often)

- Add namespace identifier to indy ledger genesis files
- Up the minimum version of node to 18.5 (latest stable)

This is to comply with the DID Indy specs having a namespace portion for faster parsing of sub name spaces
The debate here might be to use "-" versus ":" in su namespaces, in AFJ test suite, I found them using "-" while in the RFCs I found ":" this needs a discussion in Bifold sync meetings
