This PR fixes a bug where if a modal was open when the app slept, the keyboard on the PIN enter screen would be disabled when the app was reopened / device was woken up. The bug was caused by two modals attempting to be mounted at once which is not possible in React Native. There is a PR to enable multiple modals in RN but it's been open for quite some time.
