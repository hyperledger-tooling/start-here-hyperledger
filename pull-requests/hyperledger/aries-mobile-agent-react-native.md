                # Summary of Changes

Implementing our first in-app tour. The feature is optional and is not configured to be on by default. Here's what it looks like:
![in_app_tour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32586431/233558045-7fe638c6-84d5-4533-9694-730227cccc94.gif)
Apologies for the many changes, it was a painful feature to implement. Also note that you ignore the double 'Welcome' text, I made the gif before merging in main with the latest changes.

There was an issue that when the credential is deleted the details screen fails because the credential it was looking up no longer exists. Fixed by passing in the credential so the lookup `useCredentialById` is no longer needed.

Previously the verifier functionality would only restrict by schema_id. This would allow anyone to issue themselves a credential that would pass the proof request. I changed the functionality to allow all restrictions specified by anoncreds: https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#restrictions
