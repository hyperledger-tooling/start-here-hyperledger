To help make Bifold more customizable, I tried to move a lot of the text styling and colors used throughout the app to their own individual assignments in the theme file. Please let me know if there is any feedback or ideas on how to improve these changes or make the naming / grouping more intuitive. 

Also included in this PR - updated ContactListItem styling to better reflect the new chat functionality, and added a line to auto run the post-install patches following an npm install.
