Added status bar background to IOS. IOS doesn't really have a notion of status bar background colour, the IOS status bar is always transparent. I added a simple view at the top of the modal to give the effect of a coloured status bar. I added the component to the usebiometry in the settings as well as the camera disclosure modal
