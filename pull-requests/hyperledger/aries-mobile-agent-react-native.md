Some yack shaving: I just aligned the nav stack param names, prop type names, and use the colour pallet from `Theme.ts`.

# Pull Request Checklist

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes. Please make sure that you tick all _appropriate_ boxes. But please read our [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at least once; it will save you a few review cycles!

If an item doesn't apply to your pull request, **check it anyway** to make it apparent that there's nothing to do.

- [x] All commits contain a DCO `Signed-off-by` line (we use the [DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce this).
- [x] Updated LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.md for any added dependencies or vendored components.
- [x] Run prettier: `npm run style-format`
- [x] Updated **documentation** for changed code and new or modified features.

If you have _any_ questions to _any_ of the points above, just **submit and ask**! This checklist is here to _help_ you, not to deter you from contributing!
