Included in this PR are updates to the chat screen and updates to the time formatter. The actions slider (where you can send proof requests in chat) has been customized to look like our other modals, the contact list screen now uses the timestamp of the most recent message (not the createdAt date), and custom icons have been added for chat messages with attachments that can be opened. 

### Here are some screenshots of the various time stamp formats and chat screen updates:
