Now, if you enable connection invitations in developer settings, there are few new features. There is now a menu option to share your QR code, an additional header button to add contacts, and a new two-tab scan screen where you can tab between scanning other people's QRs and sharing your own. Upon successful scanning of a shared QR code, both users are propelled to the chat screen through the connection screen. It's so fast that you don't really see the connection screen (loading screen basically) but oh well.

Here is what it looks like:

becuase we didn't have goal codes set up before, when Jason implemented the changes to the connection flow, he had to remove the loading screen functionality in the mobile verifier flow. This PR restores the origional flow and adds a hook to fetch the oob record from a conneciton ID which gives you the goal code.

Previously if the wallet timeout was reached and the user was locket out, it wouldn't close the wallet. This resulted in the mobile verifier feature not working, the loading screen would hang on the presenter side and they would never receive a proof request. I added functionality to close the wallet on a timeout and it seems to have resolved the issue.

Sheldon asked for Unverified Person templates for ease of testing, Decided to make them development only templates so they don't end up in prod.
- Added extra toggle on developer menu to include development templates
- Bound inputs so that when the dev templates toggle is on, verifier feature must be enabled. Conversely when the verifier feature is turned off, dev template must also be turned off
