# Summary of Changes

Previously the wallet would not handle any deeplinks while the wallet was locked. Also, the user would be presented with a blank screen when deeplinking while on the credentialOfferAccept screen or the proofRequestAccept screen.

Now when the user clicks on a deeplink, if the wallet is in any locked state (eg: PINLockout, InactivityTimeout, PINEnter, etc) then bifold will save the deeplink to the store, and the deeplink will be activated when the user logs in.

To better automate keeping the genesis transaction up-to-date I'm propose merging them into a single JSON file that can easily be updated using the included JavaScript file `make-block.js`. This script pull down the genesis files from the ledger monitor repo and then imports all the latest genesis transactions.

# Summary of Changes

Recent change #476 added structure for default OCA bundle that does not conform to previous credential branding properties, therefore default text colour generator was receiving an `undefined` background colour for context. This PR fixes the issue.

# Summary of Changes

Previously when updating the biometrics preferences through the settings screen, the user could sometimes click the back button before they were prompted to enter their pin. These changes disable the back button on the navigator after the user has updated their biometrics preferences, and re-enables the back button after the user has supplied their PIN.
