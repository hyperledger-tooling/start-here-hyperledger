iOS 14+ uses local network permissions at app start which triggers permissions package to start, incorrectly configured Podfile and outdated package version cause an exception trigger at iOS app startup
Updated `react-native-permissions` package and added configuration in Podfile
Also tested Android to make sure updating package doesn't affect the flow

If a proof is not in the request-received state then it will error out when sending. I've added functionality to disable the share button if a proof is not in the request received state
