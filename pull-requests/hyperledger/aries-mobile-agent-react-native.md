I've added the animation to indicate a credential was successfully added to the wallet. I'm going to do a 2nd PR to cleanup the transitions between state. I think there are places where I choose to render the View where I should be choosing what Text to show. This causes things to jump around in the UI a bit. Its beyond the scope of this PR which is why its not included now.

Check out [this video](https://fullboarca-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jason_leach_fullboar_ca/ETMYDKye7fBOn-5oF8z7uLIBcLvijZHHEFKe9GY4eKX5PA?e=K0GT2M) to see what it looks like.

To help make Bifold more customizable, I tried to move a lot of the text styling and colors used throughout the app to their own individual assignments in the theme file. Please let me know if there is any feedback or ideas on how to improve these changes or make the naming / grouping more intuitive. 

Also included in this PR - updated ContactListItem styling to better reflect the new chat functionality, and added a line to auto run the post-install patches following an npm install.
