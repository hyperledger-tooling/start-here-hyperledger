Applied watermark speedup to oca 1.0 and 1.1 credential branding
- Used OnLayout to fetch card 1.1 height and width
- On card 1.0 height is determined by the width of the screen so we just use that calculation
- Factored out some of the math used to compute watermark length

Configures initial publishing processes to be able to manually release versions as well as does some refinement of the build config using TS. Draws on some configurations/structures used in AFJ. Used to manually release https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-bifold/oca & https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-bifold/core

Also sets up a basic react native package with native modules for the new Core package. This should put the OCA package in a place that we can get the OCA resolver code moved over and published for use.

@cvarjao will be happy to note that I think we may be able to do yarn 3 and lerna, so we may not have to downgrade to yarn 1 (but we can revisit if needed in the future).

I don't expect this PR to impact anything in the legacy core/app, but please let me know if it does cause any issues @bryce-mcmath (the most likely thing to impact it is the changes I made to the ./tsconfig.json).
