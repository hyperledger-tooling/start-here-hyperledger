# Summary of Changes

On smaller screen sizes, when deleting a credential the `Remove` and `Cancel` buttons will be cut off by the screen. I added scroll functionality to the credential delete screen so that users on all screen sizes can access the buttons correctly

I needed to replace the FlatList since react complains when you have a list inside of a ScrollView
