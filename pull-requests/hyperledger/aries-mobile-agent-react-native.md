Added status bar background to IOS. IOS doesn't really have a notion of status bar background colour, the IOS status bar is always transparent. I added a simple view at the top of the modal to give the effect of a coloured status bar. I added the component to the usebiometry in the settings as well as the camera disclosure modal

Previously the toasts that let the user know a credential or contact had been removed were being covered by the common remove modal. This PR addresses that. It's not a perfect fix but since we're looking at swapping toasts out entirely, it'll do for now.

Here's what it looks like:
