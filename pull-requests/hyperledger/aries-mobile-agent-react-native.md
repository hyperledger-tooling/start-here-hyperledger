As per [RFC0037](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md) its not clear if an ACK should be send when a proof is recieved. This can lead to a state where the wallet does not know if the present proof workflow is complete or not. This fixes the issue.
