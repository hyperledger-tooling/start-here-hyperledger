I find inconsistent imports can cause more merge conflicts and mental effort than should be. How about we get VSCode to manage consistency for us? I've added a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the directive for VSCode to organize imports on save. It will put them in order, remove unused imports, and keep them formatted propertly. 

It's fine if ppl don't use VSCode, those of us using it will have imports organize on save. As the app stabilizes over time I expect imports will change less frequently.

Implement an application theming pattern to start the conversation on the subject.

This PR uses the [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/native) theming library and Provider pattern to expose a theme to the application. This is not a complete implementation but rathe the scaffolding. Once merged others can work to pull the pattern through the application and add additional attributes like border radii, font weight and size, etc.

A few advantages to this include:

* Positive developer experience;
* Traditional CSS syntax;
* Simple to use, lightweight library allows one to clearly create styled components;
* Theme exposed via Provider / props for simple usage;
* Includes a <Global /> component which can be used to insert global css like resets or font faces;
* Works with RactJS making on-boarding web developers easier (less time learning technologies and more time solving problems);
