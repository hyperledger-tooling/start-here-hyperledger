- Add navigation and status bar to Credential Offer and Proof Request screens when displayed as modals (following a connection). This PR may look like allot of changes but it has a file rename, and I included a `FauxNavigationBar` component I though I would need (before I discover I could just update screen options in the nav stack).

- Fixed the status bar colour on Android. Android has a blue bar at the tope so it should always be dark where as iOS uses the background colour.

Some testsIDs are not being exposed properly to automated testing so I changed the hierarchy a little which fixes the issue.

# Summary of Changes

As I mentioned in this morning's Bifold User Group call, here's the fix we've identified for allowing us to connect to multiple ledgers at agent initialization in iOS release environments ([AFJ issue #647](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/647)). This should improve the first issuance time performance (to match that of subsequent issuances). I've got more documentation and notes to add (hence the draft status), but if I could get a test to ensure this works on your end first @jleach that'd be really helpful.
