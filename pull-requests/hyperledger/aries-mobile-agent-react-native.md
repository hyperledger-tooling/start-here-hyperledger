Sometimes the `CameraDisclosureModal` appears completely black (on iOS).
The solution found was to remove `<Modal>` from the `LoadingModal` as it was causing conflict with `CameraDisclosureModal`.
`LoadingModal` will still appear as a modal because the `presentation` property is defined as `modal` on `RootStack`.
