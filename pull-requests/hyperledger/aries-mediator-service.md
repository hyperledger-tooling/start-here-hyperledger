<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>42.0.2 - 2024-01-30</p>
<pre><code>
* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.1.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the use of Python buffer protocol objects in
  ``sign`` and ``verify`` methods on asymmetric keys.
* Fixed an issue with incorrect keyword-argument naming with ``EllipticCurvePrivateKey``
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.exchange`,
  ``X25519PrivateKey``
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PrivateKey.exchange`,
  ``X448PrivateKey``
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PrivateKey.exchange`,
  and ``DHPrivateKey``
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dh.DHPrivateKey.exchange`.
<p>.. _v42-0-1:</p>
<p>42.0.1 - 2024-01-24
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with incorrect keyword-argument naming with <code>EllipticCurvePrivateKey</code>
:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.sign</code>.</li>
<li>Resolved compatibility issue with loading certain RSA public keys in
:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_public_key</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v42-0-0:</p>
<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
  or
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.
* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with
  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.
* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.
* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.
* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should
  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per
  process.
* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for
  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the
  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for
  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and
  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.
* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature
  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 
</code></pre>
