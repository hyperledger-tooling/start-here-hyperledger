                It currently takes me about 5 attempts to start up a dev environment, because the CLI expects me to task-switch back to my commandline within a 2min window (having task switched out to doing something else, when I kicked off `ff start`).

So I'm raising this as a proposal to give me 10mins instead. Hope that's ok
