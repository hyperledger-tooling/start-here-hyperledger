                We've had support for external Ethereum RPC nodes for a while now, but we've never had full support for external (not generated by the FireFly CLI) Fabric networks. There's still a fair amount of manual config editing necessary to create a Fabric Common Connection Profile, but I am not aware of any tooling that can autogenerate that at the moment.

There is a corresponding tutorial for using this new capability here:
https://github.com/kaleido-io/firefly/blob/fabric-test-network-tutorial/docs/tutorials/chains/fabric_test_network.md

This PR also splits out the `init` command into two subcommands so we can keep Ethereum and Fabric specific flags separate. The new commands are:

- `ff init ethereum ...`
- `ff init fabric ...`

The existing `ff init` command continues to maintain backwards compatibility for now, but new flags going forward will be added to the newer, more specific subcommands.
