                The chaincode PODS don Â´t have defined the resource limits.

Those limits can be configured in:

1. Chaincode Artifacts - image.json;
2. Environment Variables;
4. etc?

                Based on discussions with @y12studio in #98, it would be useful to support liveness probes for chaincode containers.

I don't think there is a simple way to implement this with current Fabric capabilities since the peer<->chaincode communication is via a long-lived grpc stream, and I'm not sure what chaincode language neutral alternatives might be possible instead.

One possibility is to update the Fabric protos to add a liveness service for chaincode implementations to (optionally?) support this requirement. The peer uses a separate operations service for [health checks](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/operations_service.html#health-checks) but that doesn't seem like a good approach for chaincode.

                Ideally the k8s pod should be terminated if the peer is terminated. This is related to #88 however it will not always be possible to add an owner reference.
