                ### Description
As a contributor I want to be able to debug the failing tests on the CI server directly so that I can figure out what is going wrong even if my tests are only failing on the CI server and not on my local machine (which is a very common scenario at present...)

Use this (?) => https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-ssh

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Works out of the box with VSCode debugger (preferably, but other is acceptable too)
2. GIF tutorial in CONTRIBUTING.md showing exactly how it's done in 30 seconds or less.
