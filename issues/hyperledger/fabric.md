            <td>
                When installing a new chaincode on the peer you do get the package id of the chaincode which is good... this allows customers to use that data to go through the approve/commit steps.

However the issue is when they are reinstalling an existing chaincode there is nothing in the response to indicate the package id(hash). Install in that case returns a message that the chaincode already exists. We should include the package id of the chaincode in the response when it is already installed on the peer.

                Per stackoverflow post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69115892/hyperledger-fabric-java-chaincode-timeout-expired-while-starting-chaincodeÂ  , it appears Java chaincode is missing from chaincode as an external service doc topic:
